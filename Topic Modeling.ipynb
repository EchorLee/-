       "[\"tl;dr\\n\\nSeafood-heavy elegant tasting menu. Low on gimmicks, but entirely satisfying. I think it's better than Le Bernardin, and on par with EMP.\\n\\n----\\n\\nAt the time of this review, I have been to 3 three-stars in NYC as well as 4 two-stars in NYC -- Brooklyn Fare was a wonderful surprise.\\n\\n(for reference, our dinner was late March 2019)\\n\\nRESERVATIONS:\\nI'm not sure if it's the move to Manhattan with more seats, but getting a reservation was not a big deal at all. You do have to call the reservation line on Monday morning to guarantee the best availability for the seats, but if you call when they open, you should get straight through to the receptionist. They book exactly 6 weeks in advance, and most likely you will be booking for the week that just opened, but they do have some sporadic spots in the intervening weeks, so plan ahead! I'm not sure why they haven't adopted Tock like all the other fine-dining restaurants, but I was happy that the reservation system was less of a headache than I expected.\\n\\nThey will confirm with you immediately via email, and then again a week before the dinner. They will charge your credit card a week in advance.\\n\\nGETTING THERE:\\nNot much to say, it's in the northeastern back corner of the Brooklyn Fare supermarket (go in, it will be the innermost corner on the right side -- the grocery store worker who showed us the way was pretty amused -- I wonder how many times he has to point people dressed in jackets and suits to the back corner every night). Be on time! We showed up on the dot and almost everyone during our seating was already there. They say on the reservation that you might miss dishes if you show up late, but we were next to a couple who showed up about 20 minutes late and they simply caught them up by presenting them with multiple dishes at a time so they ended up not actually missing anything.\\n\\nMENU:\\nI knew that they were seafood-centric before the visit, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well the fish was executed in each dish. Over the course of the meal, you will taste various different varieties of fish -- all sushi-grade -- prepared in various ways (but predominantly grilled over their charcoal fire). One mini qualm I have with sushi restaurants is that no matter how good the fish, sushi omakases are still limited in preparation techniques -- essentially, everything is just raw or seared. However, each fish grilled to perfection at BF, something that I consider to be more exciting than served as nigiri in an omakase.\\n\\nThe king crab with caviar served in a vin jaune sauce was one of the most memorable dishes that I have ever tasted.\\n\\nThe beginning uni/truffle/brioche course, although photogenic and emblematic of BF, was a bit underwhelming, probably because it is actually relatively simple to put together, even though the ingredients themselves are decadent.\\n\\nOverall, I did enjoy BF more than Le B, mainly because I found them to be more inventive and creative compared to the more classical preparations at the latter establishment. Even though dining here costs a pretty penny, the sheer amount of seafood done well I feel makes up for it. The menu could be a tad bit longer for the cost though, and I actually found it quite curious that there were no carbs during the entire meal (no bread, no noodles, just a bit of risotto).\\n\\nBEVERAGES:\\nDid their wine pairing (includes sake), like probably 80% of everyone else. Interestingly, they don't have a cocktail menu. The pairing was decent -- heavy on whites (although to be expected). Loved a late-harvest dry riesling from Germany and a surprisingly pleasant strawberry sake for the dessert course. $195 for a pairing. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nAttentive, but not outstanding. No gift bag like most 3-star establishments. You'll get your dinner menu in an envelope sealed in wax when you leave. Although the reservation states that jackets are required, they seem to be pretty lax about what you wear under the jacket itself. I saw everywhere from guys in full suits to people simply wearing a blazer over a T-shirt...so basically, you don't need to fret too much about their dress code :)\\n\",\n",
       " 'I could write a long review ... talk about all dishes ... but others have done it better than me ...\\n\\nSo I will just remember the first dish: Japanese Sea Urchin from Hokkaido with truffle.\\n\\nOne of the best thing I was lucky enough to taste.\\n\\nClose your eyes when you see the bill. It is absolutely too expensive.\\n',\n",
       " \"Went there for my 30's birthday. Everything is on point. Love that Chef Ramirez greeted everyone when we came in, very serious, no smile tho. \\nHere's some of my favorite courses. \\n1. Sea Urchin toast, with truffle on top. Very flavorful. High start. Don't think you can go wrong with all the ingredients.\\n2. Crab with caviar. It has an interesting curry flavor. Exotic, but not too much. Brilliant!\\n3. Langoustine. It's very buttery, but good. Tastes very like lobster.\\n4. Wagyu. They cooked a huge loaf of wagyu together, and then cut it like bread. It's amazing that each slice of wagyu is very finely cooked. Well balanced fat and lean. The sauce tastes like Worcestershire. A little bit sour, and perfectly balanced the fat. It looks medium done to me, not like usual rare done, but still super tender and juicy. Love it!\\n5. Frozen Hoji soufflé. I am a huge soufflé lover. And the frozen one is even better! Had hoji icecream in Hong-Kong before. Have been missing it a lot. This is even better than earl grey!\\n\\nI know Chef's table is famous for the seafood dish. We did have MANY fish, from all over the places, with grains/ medium cooked/ sashimi likes/ well done with stuffed mushroom( that mushroom is really amazing!)They are all good. However, there were too many of them, and it's hard to tell which one stands out from which. Mostly all seared with a wood taste, and with some sauce. I know they are famous for the freshness. But can't appreciate it that much and it kind of gets boring at the end.\\n\\nBtw, do not like their Italian strawberry dish. The best strawberry I had was the one freshly picked from the farm. And you don't need to go to Michelin restaurant for that.\\n\",\n",
       " \"A truly memorable dining experience, simultaneously transcendent and grounded. Rooted in Japanese influence yet executed with contemporary flair, the menu at Chef's Table came in parts:\\n\\nFirst, a series of show-stopping seafood courses, from brioche piled high with Hokkaido uni and blackest truffle slice you'll ever see to a generous serving of melt-in-your-mouth langoustine with picked kelp and kinome leaf. Highlighting a majority of the fish courses (including Kinmedai and Sawara) were the unbelievable sauces, the source of most of the meal's gusto, concocted with less-than-subtle ingredients such as dill and ginger with flavor not unlike a fireworks display made liquid form.\\n\\nTwo savory courses followed--a perfect preparation of French quail that completely eclipsed a similar offering from E.M.P., and a surprisingly large portion of A5 Wagyu cooked sous vide to pinpoint precision. By the end I was the only diner left standing, and since the restaurant doesn't allow take-home potions, I was basically force feeding myself everyone else's food at that point.\\n\\nI was almost ready to throw in the towel when our dessert courses came, mercilessly light--a kaffir lime sorbet, and a frozen vanilla souffle which perplexed and satisfied my taste buds from first bite to last.\\n\\nIn the spirit of true Japanese cuisine, the meal at CT/BF was able to spotlight the essence of each ingredient in beautiful ways, focusing on freshness and the painstakingly refined combination of stark flavor. This was made particularly clear by one of the stand-out dishes of the evening, a small tower of foie gras, scallop, and crisped kelp. I don't particularly care for those ingredients individually, yet when combined the union of taste and texture was almost overwhelming.\\n\\nIf it were up to me, I would probably ease up on the amount of food and take a load off of everyone's wallets--but it isn't up to me, and reservations are nigh-impossible to come by, so whatever they're doing is clearly working. One of the hallmark meals New York has to offer.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I wasn't sure I was in\\u200b the right place initially. Walking into a small supermarket fully dressed up for an elegant dinner felt odd, to be honest. I finally exhaled when I spotted the host stand hidden towards the back. \\n\\nFrom beginning to end, dinner was everything I hoped it would be and more.\\n\\nThe set up is based around one large, three-sided counter where guests look directly into the kitchen. The barstools are spacious and comfortable. Behind them, on the main floor, several booths and tables are available for additional seating. I'm always fascinated by the discipline and flawless kitchen dance when preparing for service. The staff at CTBF nailed it. \\n\\nWe dined off a set menu and enjoyed every single course. I'm still longing for the Hamachi Tartlet, the Hokkaido Sea Urchin, and Langoustine + Ravioli. \\n\\nSmall modifications were happily honored for a friend in our party. Service was friendly and, basically, IMPECCABLE. I know in the past photos were not allowed, but this was not an issue here at all. Even the playlist rocked! \\n\\nI hope to visit once again in the near future!\\n\",\n",
       " \"What can you say about a Michelin *** star restaurant that others have not said before?\\n\\nPros-food really is amazing, excellent tasting menu, focus is on the food and menu.\\n\\nCons-the sommelier was a bit rough and the single unisex bathroom outside the restaurant in the grocery store.\\n\\nThis is certainly one of the best meals I have eaten.  The food is meticulously prepared with an incredible taste.  The presentation is excellent and the service is professional. \\n\\nThough excellent, a lot of dining has to be in the moment.  The minor cons, which are permissible when there are lower expectations, become a sticking point at a 3 star Michelin.  For this reason it received only a 4/5.\\n\\nFood is really amazing but dining is an individual experience and though wow'ed by many details wasn't blown away by the whole experience.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Really enjoyed my trip to chef's table and I think it is deserving of all of the hype. As a tip - the restaurant is at the back of a little market (you'll see a hostess stand). They're pretty strict on dinner timings, so be aware of that.\\n\\nWe had a little trouble getting a reservation, but were lucky to get a spot after trying for weeks. The tasting menu is really great - my favorites of our 6+ courses were the sea urchin and the fluke. We sat at the bar and it was great to see everyone prepare everything.\\n\\nOverall, amazing (but pricy) experience. If you ever have the chance to go, would recommend.\\n\",\n",
       " 'It was OK, but just OK.\\n\\nFor some reason I felt like the dishes taste the same. They were served in almost identical sauce. Also it is not a well balanced meal - almost no vegetables. \\n\\nThe dessert tasted fine but not a Michelin 3 star standard.\\n\\nSave your money for somewhere else.\\n',\n",
       " 'Been there 3x love this place, always amaizng! Must try if your in new york! I love their seafood, and the Uni dishes are fantastic!\\n',\n",
       " \"Located inside the Brookyln Fare Market, Chef's Table is a three starred michelin restaurant. It was open kitchen so we could see how food was prepared. Every dish had a unique quality and presentation. But compared with other michelin three star restaurants, I expected a better service.\\n\",\n",
       " \"3.5 would be more accurate for this review but Yelp doesn't allow that. \\n\\nThis is definitely not a \\u200b3 Michelin\\u200b Star caliber restaurant. Before anyone throws any shade - please look at my Michelin Madness\\u200b list, we have been to every 3 Michelin Star restaurant in NYC and multiple 1 and 2 star restaurants. \\n\\nAt best, this could be 1 Michelin star. The service was fantastic. The servers are friendly and helpful - even for the most ridiculous requests - looking at you my fellow diner who thought her scallop was not the same quality as her dining partner's and raised a fuss. \\n\\nThe space is warm and sophisticated\\u200b. The music is top notch (best of the 80's - Hall and Oats, Led Zeplin, Stevie Wonder).\\n\\nWe went for the white truffle supplement, so we totally gave this restaurant the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\nWe had:\\n\\n- Sea Urchin on a Brioche with white truffles\\u200b - delicious\\u200b but heavy\\n\\n- Trout - very good\\n\\n- Scottish\\u200b Langoustine - delicious, one of our favorite\\u200b types of shellfish\\n\\n- Saba - tasty\\n\\n- Kinmedai - very tasty\\n\\n- Crab - delicious\\u200b but\\u200b very heavy in a cream sauce\\n\\n- Diver Scallop with Truffles - very good\\n\\n- Wild Sea Bass - heavy and fishy\\n\\n- Duck with foie gras - very good but heavy\\n\\n- Wagyu with French black truffles - delicious but heavy, and why black truffles, we paid for white Alba truffles? White truffles and wagyu are a match made in heaven. French black truffles are a delicious albeit\\u200b cheaper alternative.\\n\\n- Truffle Ice Cream with Caramel Sauce - very good but not the best use of the truffles\\n\\n- Frozen Souffle - Tasteless styrofoam \\n\\n- Cream Puff - Inedible - tasted like burnt popcorn\\n\\n- Coconut Birthday Cake - no taste\\n\\nAs you can see there were a few hits but also quite a few misses. Dessert was a total waste. For a restaurant of this caliber and price tag,\\u200b\\u200b there should be no misses. \\n\\nAlso, the meal wasn't balanced. Typically tasting menus go from very light to heavy. This went from heavy to super heavy. By the time we got to the duck with Foie Gras and wagyu beef we were stuffed and were hoping that the food would stop coming. \\n\\nIn fact,\\u200b we were sympathizing\\u200b with the poor duck who donated his liver for the Foie Gras as we knew how stuffed he must have felt before meeting his maker. \\n\\nFYI - We ate 22+ courses at Masa and didn't feel this stuffed nor did we feel overloaded a Per Se. \\n\\nThe white truffles were wasted on the ice cream. There are so many better ways to serve truffles than to put them on a dessert - seriously they should have gone on the wagyu. Replacing one of the many fish courses\\u200b with a pasta course (with truffles) would have been nice.\\n\\nWe had a good night, the food was enjoyable and the staff was wonderful. Will we come back? Probably not. \\n\\nBrooklyn has a lot of good, even great restaurants, but it is not Manhattan as far as superior cuisine goes. \\n\\nBrooklyn Fare should have stayed in Brooklyn.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Chef\\'s Table used to be located in Brooklyn for seven years until the relocation in December 2016 to the Hell\\'s Kitchen district in midtown Manhattan. Inside this nondescript supermarket, there is a world-class restaurant. The restaurant itself isn\\'t large, with a L shaped stainless-steel counter as a centerpiece. The ambiance is modern and minimal, where everything serves a purpose.\\n\\nShortly after seating, Chef Ramirez emerged from the kitchen and greeted every table \"Welcome, Good Evening\". He definitely errs more on the serious side, but still friendly. A man of little words, but his dishes speak volumes. Regarding the \"no photo\" rule, they lessened the rigidity of this concept, and you can take photos sitting at the table but not at the counter. Discretely, I was told. This was happy news for me, as I could not imagine not having memories of one of the best meals of my life.\\n\\nThe tasting menu started off on a strong note with an amazing bluefin tuna tart. We were advised to eat this in one bite asap before the pastry goes soggy. The fatty tuna shined like jewels. Seasoned simply with ginger and yuzu, the flavours were clean and elegant. It also had incredible visual appeal, almost resembling a flower.\\n\\nUpon tasting the next amuse bouche, it was a unanimous decision among my family that this is the most memorable dish of the night! Fresh Hokkaido sea urchin roe on top of brioche, topped with a slice of perigord truffle. Even under the dim lighting, the dish dazzled me with its enticing glossy shine. The sea urchin was sublime, even more plump than the ones I remember from my Hokkaido trip. One bite and I was flooded with a sweet creaminess similar to custard, and a slight crunch from the toasted brioche.\\n\\nTime for a seafood break! I really enjoyed this next dish, as it reminds me of a comfort food my mom used to make when I was younger. Known as chawanmushi, this is essentially a steamed savoury egg custard. However, chef Ramirez used corn purée instead of eggs. On top. charred corn kernels contrasted the silky smooth custard. Finished off with pieces of creamy foie gras and a savoury dashi layer, this further accentuated the sweetness of the dish.\\n\\nSawara (Spanish mackerel) tasted intense with and a meaty texture. The outer layer is carefully smoked, as mackerel\\'s oils tend to absorb smoke better than leaner fish. The crispy kelp added some texture to the mackerel. Underneath is a small pool of rice vinegar, which accented the mackerel\\'s robust flavour.\\n\\nThis was one of my favourites one of the evening; akamutsu (red sea perch) from Chiba. The flesh was rich, and easily flaked apart. The oils from the akamutsu seeped into the Koshikihari rice underneath. There were also bits of sea urchin in the rice.\\n\\nNext dish was another favourite of mine. Wild sea bass from Holland was cooked sous-vide, resulting in an extraordinarily tender piece of fish. A generous spoonful of Kaluga caviar accompanied the bass. These glistening black pearls were nutty with a buttery mouthfeel. To my surprise, it wasn\\'t overly salty like I expected, with an undertone of smokiness. The savoury sabayon was creamy, balanced off with a mysterious tartness I couldn\\'t identify.\\n\\nAbalone from Monterey Bay surprised me. This mollusk is not commonly used in Western kitchens, but it\\'s a highly prized ingredient in Asia. It doesn\\'t have a particular taste, but its unique texture is comparable to a cross between mushroom and calamari. The earthy almost chocolate aroma of the shaved black truffle was intoxicating. I really liked the jus, which tasted strongly of caramelized onions and a sweet wine (ie madera or sherry). This is a successful East meets West fusion creation.\\n\\nThe one meat course was a show stopper; A5 Miyazaki Wagyu. Unlike regular beef which comprises of mostly saturated fat, wagyu contains oleic acid, an unsaturated fat responsible for the umami flavour of wagyu. The incredible snowflake marbling was mesmerizing to look at. Cooked to a perfect medium, this melted like butter. The velvety texture lingered on my palate ever so slightly. With a protein like this, the red pepper relish wasn\\'t necessary.\\n\\nFrozen vanilla soufflé is often raved by everyone. It was fluffy and airy, which wasn\\'t surprising as it incorporated liquid nitrogen. The coolness made the soufflé more appealing to eat in the hot summer month. Underneath, there were white chocolate balls which added a pleasant crunch.\\n\\nEven though Chef\\'s Table is a steep expense on the wallet, it\\'s evident that Chef Ramirez spares no cost in sourcing the best world-class ingredients for his customers. The majority of his seafood comes fresh from Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, flown in daily. Other restaurants would definitely charge an extra charge for luxury items like black truffle, caviar, bluefin tuna etc. One of the best meals I\\'ve ever had, and I don\\'t say that lightly.\\n',\n",
       " \"Finally got to see what the hype was about.  Overall, was an interesting experience with a number of very good dishes.  Also pretty different from the other Michelin three stars in the city, maybe with a little bit more Brooklyn edginess vs. typical old world charm.\\n\\nRestaurant is small but actually not a very intimate vibe.  Service is generally attentive, but not as stuffy as some of the other three stars.  I will say there was a small fly buzzing around (for a while even...) which was seen and commented on by multiple diners, a bit surprising to me for a restaurant at this price point..\\n\\nThe meal starts off more light/Japanese, and ends more heavy/French, is how the waiter explained.  Style of the food is all seafood ex two meat courses.  When I say all seafood I mean mostly fish after fish after fish, with very little veggies to be honest.. I think the only green leaf I ate was some tiny garnish on one of the dishes.  \\n\\nBut you will get an umami explosion of a meal, which you won't get from any other western resto (in NYC.. as far as I know.. lmk if you know otherwise!), very dramatic contrast with the European style seafood restaurants in the city like Le Bernardin or Marea.  The dishes also seem more simply prepared, in keeping with the Japanese influence.\\n\\nOnto the food..\\n\\nReally amazing:\\n\\n1) Frozen soufflé was for me best of the night - without too many spoilers, everything went so well together, from the beautiful plate it came in, to the  taste of the powder they sprinkle on, the bits of surprising finds at the bottom of the dish... even the name (which is a clever misdirection because it's not really a real soufflé) for me this was a Michelin three star quality dish, not just executed well but creatively designed and delightful to eat.\\n\\nVery very good dishes:\\n2) Baby red snapper with squid ink rice - the flavor complexity of this dish was impressive.\\n3) Akamutsu with chanterelles - again extremely umami dish with a delicious broth.\\n4) Duck with prosciutto and berries - I demand to only eat duck if it comes with prosciutto from now on... seriously I don't know why other restaurants don't do this!\\n5) Kaffir lime sorbet - very good minty follow up to the richness of the wagyu.\\n6) Shima aji amuse bouche - in tiny tart form, very umami but light and intriguing first course to pique your interest.\\n\\nAlso very good:\\n7) Uni bread with black truffle - fluffiness of the bread went very well with the uni.\\n8) Wagyu beef coin - very fatty marbling.  \\n9) Beluga caviar in the sea bass course - very good on its own.\\n... these are only in this section because they are a bit similar to how other high end restaurants work these ingredients.  Still great execution but less creative for me.\\n\\nDid not work for me:\\n9a) Sea bass next to the beluga caviar - was a little bit tough.\\n10) Langoustine - a bit rubbery, did not enjoy.  I think langoustine should be treated like shrimp or lobster - if it will turn out anything but soft and melt in your mouth, probably best to not include at all.  Also it came with a piece of cheese on top that may have made it more chewy than it had to be, while the taste didn't quite go along.\\n11) Turbot - I was not a fan of the heavy sauce that came with it, which felt overwhelming to me and did not go with the fish.\\n\\nThe remaining two courses (crab - which looked pretty, and caramel milk ice cream) were not bad but also not extremely memorable.\\n\\nOverall - despite some unevenness with a few dishes I didn't like, the bright spots were very good and it does seem like they take risks. Worth a visit especially if you prefer an umami palate.\\n\",\n",

After the first signature uni course, strangely it was all fish afterwards until the wagyu and desserts. It was a very heavy and greasy dinner with cooked fish for a whole dinner, it felt a little intrusive to not have any appetizer-type of \"preparation\". Every dish felt like a main course. The service that night seemed to rush the process, and we finished dinner within 2 hours I believe. It was a strange experience and hope this is not a permanent change in its standard...\\n',\n",

He replied, \"three stars.\"  I laughed, thinking he wasn\\'t serious, but he was totally serious.  \"Three Michelin stars,\" he said. \\n\\nI feel like I should just end the review here, but if you\\'re reading this, you\\'re probably curious what we ate, otherwise you wouldn\\'t be looking up Chef\\'s Table on Yelp (I know I didn\\'t bother with reviews before eating!).\\n\\nOur meal was quite seafood intensive, and it was glorious.  Every dish was well planned and executed, and you could really savor all of the different ingredients, both individually as well as together as a whole dish.\\n\\n1. Hamachi tartlet -- flavor explosion in my mouth, as I followed the instruction to eat it all in one bite.  It was pretty amazing how there are all these different flavors -- sweet, savory, sour, etc. going on at once, yet the freshness of the hamachi still shines through.\\n\\n2. Hookaido sea urchin -- served over perfectly baked brioche and topped with truffle.  So creamy, so fragrant, so many flavors working together again.\\n\\n3. Kaluga queen caviar -- caviar \"swimming\" over the freshest tuna, and all complemented with cucumber and more creaminess.\\n\\n4. Sawara -- beautifully presented with yet more edible flowers and the most delicious sauce.  The fish itself was perfectly cooked and very light; did not have any of the fishiness that mackerel typically has (which I normally enjoy, btw, but this fish was so delicate and delicious, I loved it too...even though I wouldn\\'t have guessed it to be mackerel if I didn\\'t know).\\n\\n5. King crab -- more edible flowers and creaminess to highlight the freshness of the seafood.  I\\'m starting to be very impressed by how all these creamy sauces don\\'t mask the flavor of the seafood at all.\\n\\n6. Chiba Akamutsu -- another perfectly cooked fish, this time served over a risotto-like rice, which had little uni bits mixed in!\\n\\n7. Langoustine -- the best prepared langoustine ever.  And obviously super high quality langoustine -- you could taste the natural sweetness of it.  It was served over what looked just to be foam but was actually a mound of the richest, most buttery cauliflower ever.  But as delicious as the buttery cauliflower was, it was borderline too heavy for me, and I would\\'ve been quite happy to just eat that langoustine all on its own.\\n\\n8. Fluke -- served with the sweetest sugar snap peas and sweetest white asparagus I\\'ve ever had.  Key takeaway: quality ingredients make such a difference.\\n\\n9. Quail -- grilled and seasoned to perfection.  I was a bit distracted here by the party next to us, as one of them was hesitant to eat this because she has an aversion to eating animals that had been strangled.  Took a lot of discipline for me to not ask for her portion.  I guess she had a lucky friend who got to eat two of these.\\n\\n10. A5 Wagyu -- another perfectly grilled and seasoned dish, and the meaty mushrooms went so well with it.\\n\\n11. Yogurt with fresh, wild Malaga strawberries -- those strawberries were so sweet, and that yogurt was so creamy.  Quite possibly my favorite dessert of the night, and it\\'s not even chocolate.\\n\\n12. Milk ice cream with a lot of nutty crunchies -- simple and delicious, although less memorable.\\n\\n13. Frozen chocolate souffle -- I\\'ve never had frozen souffle before, and it was quite a fun thing to try.  The texture is so airy, sort of like meringue but without the hard/crunchy exterior.  Probably the lightest chocolate dessert there ever was, and also the most delicious, chocolatey air you\\'ll ever taste.\\n\\n14. Bonus dessert -- the kitchen sent out an extra dessert for us, as we were celebrating our 5Y anniversary.  It was a sobacha mousse over a thin layer of chocolate cake, all covered by white chocolate...yum.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, very high quality ingredients and intricately prepared and presented dishes + immaculate service = amazing experience totally worthy of those 3 Michelin stars.\\n',\n",
       " \"We celebrated our 20th anniversary here, an annual tradition we started years ago to visit a top Michelin-starred restaurant in NYC. In a word this is by far the worst one we ate in, and we've visited them all.\\n\\nThe highlight is its location. Certainly an unexpected surprise to find its entrance at the back of a food market. It's nicely decorated, although most of the place is taken up by a huge bar rather than intimate tables. The waiter was polite, but for sure forced each smile which he couldn't wait to wipe off his face. It was so disingenuous it was impossible not to notice. He rushed to describe the dishes as if he was speed reading. Next to our table the speaker blasted 70s rock music with a very poor choiced playlist that was waaay to loud.  \\n\\nThe food (we ordered a tasting menu) was  beautifully presented, but the taste was nothing to write home about. Out of 11 or so dishes we were blown away by 2, the others were bland, bitter or just odd. In all honesty, we tasted much better following a YouTube recipe cooking at home. \\n\\nIt's customary that at the end of the meal you get some token from the restaurant, a small bag with candy, a menu with a note, just a nice touch to remember them by.  Here we got a sealed envelope with a menu of what we ordered. However, the page was a sloppy mess with no care nor any attetion behind it.  Just 1 word descriptions, not even centered on the page, and no reference nor wishes of a happy anniversary nor a thank you for visiting. Very cheaply done. \\n\\nI think this restaurant is a case of the emperor with no clothes on. Because you pay $800 for 2 for a tasting menu, you're almost embarrassed to say it sucked. But it did. Do they even know who they are competing against? If you're going to spend the money, go to Eleven Madison, Daniel or Per Se. Putting this pretentious mess in tbe same category as those places is like comparing McDonald's to Jean-Georges. \\n\\nMichelin star my butt.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Chef's Table is definitely all about the food. Yeah it's kinda weird to walk through a grocery store to get to the restaurant but hey it's NYC so I think that just adds to the unique experience. But it did take me out of the immersion whenever I had to use the restroom since it's located outside the restaurant so you have to stand in the store watching people buy groceries while you wait (there's only 1 single bathroom). Other than that, we sat at the counter and definitely enjoyed our meal. \\n\\nMy husband and I are regular Michelin restaurant diners all over the country and we think this place is tied with Saison in San Francisco, another 3 star restaurant. We loved 99% of the dishes served here, especially the wagyu (best wagyu we've ever had) and shiso ice-cream. Plating wasn't creative like some of the other restaurants, and there was no Wow factor with any presentation (this is definitely not Alinéa in that regard), but this is why I say the main focus is just on the food itself. And luckily the food was very good!!\\n\",\n",
       " 'This little restaurant is tucked behind a supermarket. The place is nice and simplistic . Service was impeccable! I sat at the counter were I was able to watch the chefs prepare our food. I advise to book your reservations weeks in advance if you want to sit at the counter. The stand out dishes for me was definitely the Hokkaido uni on brioche with black truffle. One bite and I felt like I was in heaven. The next dish that was memorable would have to be the crab with caviar on top. Each bite was better than the last. The A5 wagyu was so fatty that it just melted in your mouth. Diver scallop with foie gras was full of flavor! The soufflé was so yummy and magical that I wanted more after I was done. I will definitely come back in the future.\\n',\n",
       " \"Fantastic evening - delicious food, exceptional service and wonderful company made for a perfect evening.\\n\\n15 courses total (including 4 desserts, 3 on the menu, but we were celebrating birthdays, so we received an extra) - 2 of the 4 of us are pescatarians, so the A-5 wagyu was subbed out (the meat was divine, as was the fish, I'm told).\\n\\nEach of us had a different favorite course which made the evening especially fun, discussing each beautiful plate placed in front of us.\\n\\nService is nearly impeccable. Cannot say enough good things - a MUST visit!\\n\",\n",
       " \"I somehow managed to get reservations on pretty short notice for just one person at 6:30 on a Saturday. When I showed up they ushered me to my spot at the bar. \\n\\nRegarding the service: \\nThe service overall here was impeccable. Always lots of people bustling around, giving you info about what you are having, brining new silverware. The pace is quick here. In general it seems like those that present you with the food have just enough info on the ingredients but they can't disclose and don't know everything. Seems like they don't want people attempting to recreate the dishes outside.  The gentleman next to me kept asking about what was in things and they would politely give all the info they could, followed by a statement that that was all they could say. \\n\\nI must have had upwards of 30 different utensils throughout the evening and there was a gentleman whose job it appeared was solely managing the silverware delivery and pickup! \\n\\nEveryone was nice and accommodating. Amongst some of the best service I have received. \\n\\nRegarding the food: \\nBluefin tuna tartlette - really bright flavors and the wasabi flavor really shone through in a non intimidating way. One of my favorite dishes by far! \\n\\nMadai - Japanese seabream crispy kelp - the broth was flavored well. \\n\\nSea urchin over toast Australian black truffle  - the sea urchin was smooth and not fishy at all which was perfect in my opinion. \\n\\nMaryland Diver scallop and caviar and white wine sauce  - just lightly salted, and creamy and sweet. The creaminess really made this dish sing. \\n\\nRed Sea perch from chiba - the broth that this was served with was light and bright. The broth really made the dish. The Crispiness added a nice texture. Very clean flavors. Another one of my favorites. \\n\\nScottish langoustine - the texture in general was not my favorite. The buttery sauce was good. Was hard to eat in one bite, as recommended.\\n\\nSawara - mackerel family fish  - this was my least favorite dish. The fish was a little fishier than I liked. And it was served warm. It was probably the prettiest though!\\n\\nRamp custard with charred fois gras - was in a dashi broth was my guess. The saltiness was good. I enjoyed this. \\n\\nSea bass from holland, white and green asparagus and morel mushroom - I very much enjoyed this dish. The fish tasted nice, the green sauce with the asparagus and peas were good flavors. Creamy texture. Solid dish. \\n\\nAbaloe - koshi cari rice - spring leek sauce  - this was cooked very well. The rice underneath added a wonderful creaminess and flavor that really added layers to the dish. \\n\\nWaygu beef - the flavors in this were wonderful. I really enjoyed it even though it was a touch too fatty for my liking. To be fair, I'm not a huge fan of fattiness.\\n\\nGranny apple sorbet was nice. \\n\\nWild strawberry with yogurt ice cream and some sweet sorbet underneath- this dish was fantastic. Sweet and creamy and all the right things.\\n\\nThe last course was a frozen vanilla soufflé! Holy crap this was amazing. I would like someone to bring me this every day for dessert. It melts in your mouth almost like cotton candy. And was served with a cold spoon. \\n\\nI was curious if I wanted to come back and experience a completely different menu how long would I have to wait. They informed me some dishes change weekly or seasonally. So I likely would need to come back in a while and in a different season. Some dishes are staples and even if it's not exact you might get something similar but served with a different fish etc.\\n\\nI would come back here again at some pint. In general a very positive experience. One of my favorite things here were all the patrons here LOVED good food. It was nice to talk to people that enjoy food as much as I do. Always looking for new food friends!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Best restaurant on the planet! This has been my best dining experience ever. I travel to NYC twice a year and dine at places the likes of Eleven Madison Park, ucho, sushi ginza onodera. I have been the hugest fan of eleven Madison for the last 4 or 5 years and we go on every trip. On our last trip, we had dinner at Chefs table and it blew my mind. We dined at the counter and it was such a dandy Aston experience watching the chef, spud-chefs and servers work in synchrony. The food was impeccably plated, tasted delicious and the variety of flavors on the tasting menu left little to be desired. I left full, tipsy 2and\\nVery happy. I cant wait for my next trip to NYC to go back for dinner. Thank you!\\n',\n",
       " \"This is life changing food. Worth every bit of the price, the hustle to get a reservation, and digging through the grocery store to find where you're going. \\n\\nFrom the first perfect bite of sea urchin, brioche and truffle, I honestly thought they had shot themselves in the foot. How could the food even come close to comparing to that? I am so glad that I was wrong. Each sauce more decadent, each fish more perfectly cooked than the last, each bite perfectly balanced and delicious. \\n\\nPerhaps even more impressive was the wine pairing. Though I had no idea where many of the wines were from and had not heard of many of the varietals, it was astonishing how balanced the wines were for the food. It quickly moved all of the food flavor off the palate and left your mouth longing for the next bite. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable, and never stuffy or overbearing. \\n\\nOverall, an amazing, exclusive and exceptional experience.\\n\",\n",

       " \"I was counting down the days until I could return to Chefs Table. When would I get a bite of hokkaido uni as fresh as theirs again? Or maybe another magical frozen souffle? \\n\\nI actually prefer their new location! You have to walk through Brooklyn Fare to the back. The large wood counters are much more cozy and inviting. The food is still incredible, a meal of 14 dishes that went by too fast! A few things on the menu were familiar, maybe a touch different from 2 years ago. Prices have gone up a bit starting Jan 2018, but for someone who truly enjoys food and watching the process of an open kitchen, it is well worth the splurge for a special occasion. You won't find better ingredients anywhere, and preparation retains the soul of each ingredient. \\n\\nThere are now a few tables as well, but why miss the opportunity for counter seating? Service is impeccable as always, shout-out to James who was so nice! (although the reservationist was a little offputting for some reason). For a modern unpretentious approach to classically prepared dishes, and especially mind-blowingly good uni, trust Chef Ramirez and go to Chefs Table.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Thankfully didn't experience any of the infamous racism here, but the meal fell flat otherwise. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable - from designated cutlery servers, to servers who announced the ingredients, as well as how to eat the dish (in how many bites). I came here with a friend as a birthday celebration for the both of us and they brought both of us a cake, and they were nice enough to split a wine pairing (generously) between the two of us. \\n\\nThe food however was on the simpler and disappointing side. Not many dishes stood out - the abalone, langoustine with butter and wild strawberries were my favorites. For this expensive of a price tag, I was surprised that a lot of the dishes have remained the same and there was no creativity in creating new dishes.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I couldn\\'t wait to come home and rave about this place online. One of my favorite dining experience ever! So here\\'s the trick I believe to making a reservation: try to utilize the concierge service associated with your credit card. I tried to make reservations myself but it was nearly impossible through the phone. Anyhow, once the reservation is made, expect a monumental charge to be placed onto your credit card in the days prior to your meal (I think ours came out to be just under $900 for two people).\\n\\nWhat can I say? Chef Cesar is brilliant. His food is simplistic but intricate. The food will speak for itself. I also suggest the \"shortened\" wine pairing where they feature 6 glasses for, I think, $120 per person. It coordinated beautifully with the food and I got a new list of new wines to purchase in the future. Highly recommend if you can splurge!\\n',\n",
       " \"What makes this Michelin Star restaurant different and is one that's on top of my list is the experience.  It is a show and dinner.  Think about it, you get to sit on the counter and watch the Chefs at work.  While we were expecting a crazy and wild open kitchen madness, it wasn't like that at all.  Execution was smooth, calm and perfect from cooking to serving.  Food was obviously great so no need to focus on that.  I do appreciate that they rotate the servers throughout the course so you get to interact with different people.  \\n\\nOne VERY minor note and it's my personal preference is I do wish they have a wine pairing menu that you can add with your tasting.\\n\",\n",

But when you enter the restaurant, its totally another story. The service are soooo good! They are decent but also make you feel very comfortable! From the Chef to the manager, to every one working there. They leave you with enough private space & time, but they are there whenever you need them. And they can get why you are asking the question so they are not just answering your question, but take a step forward.

We were met with some disappointments such as the sommelier didn't hear us when we asked for two champagnes and one sake to start but instead brought us 3 sakes.

Then came the rush of food being served to us as if they were racing against the clock..we were later explained that they are serving fish dishes but we had to tell them to slow it down.  \\n\\nMaybe it's because we have two non beef eaters and two non lamb eaters but most of the dishes were fish so if my friend would have to go she wouldn't have enjoyed the dinner bc she doesn't like cooked fish so much...there was not a pork or duck dish for us non beef eaters.  \\n\\nThe flavors were definitely full of surprises and it all went well.\\n\",\n",

Absolutely superb from start to finish.\\n\\nWe sat at a table, not the bar, but I never for a second felt we were missing out on anything by doing so. That said, if seeing all the details of the food preparation is important to you, then do try to sit at the bar. We felt that table seating provided a more romantic, intimate experience, which is what we wanted. \\n\\nNow, for the food! Everything was phenomenal, beautiful, and served with absolute precision. The pacing of the meal was also excellent--about 2.5 hours for 13 courses. I've frequently left other such meals completely stuffed, but not so here. Full, for sure, but not uncomfortably so. I think this was also due to the fact that they do not serve bread (thankfully). The menu on the night we went was as follows:\\n\\n--Hamachi tartlet\\n--Hokkaido sea urchin\\n--Kaluga Queen caviar\\n--King crab with dill and mustard flowers\\n--Chiba akamutsu\\n--Langoustine\\n--Root vegetables\\n--Cod with white asparagus \\n--Quail with fois gras\\n--A5 wagyu\\n--Pear with sake gelatin\\n--Malaga strawberries with milk sorbet\\n--Frozen chocolate souffle\\n--Matcha-filled cookies\\n\\nPicking a favorite dish was difficult, but I would say perhaps the chiba akamutsu (a type of perch with some sort of amazing sauce) and the root vegetables were my favorites. That's not saying much, though, since everything was incredible. Of the desserts, my favorite was the malaga strawberries. The frozen souffle was fine, but was the weakest link of the night. All the desserts were light and mild, which is what you want at that point in the meal. \\n\\nWe skipped the wine pairing and had some sort of delicious non-alcoholic house-made lemonade with endless refills.\\n\\nSome other reviewers noted that the restaurant is too warm, but I was actually chilly until half-way through the meal when the restaurant did start to warm up. It never got too hot, though. My boyfriend felt the same even though he was wearing a suit jacket.\\n\\nRegarding the dress code, every man I saw was wearing a suit. Women's outfits ranged quite a bit more.\\n\\nFinding anything to criticize here is challenging, but if I had to pick one thing it would be the music, which was classic rock. It seemed more appropriate for the grocery store in front than for the restaurant, but that's a minor complaint about an otherwise flawless experience. I certainly hope I'm lucky enough to return one day.\\n\",\n",

I think Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare is the second most expensive restaurant in NYC behind Masa.\\n\\nMy girlfriend scored us a reservation here for my birthday and I have to say that's quite a present. I have been to numerous Michelin starred restaurants before, but never a 3 star one. Knowing what I know about a few others (i.e. Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, etc) my expectations were rather high.\\n\\nThe inside is nice and not as stuffy as I expected. Obviously there's an aire of superiority in there as you expect from the average Michelin starred restaurant, but it was a little more laid back than I thought even down to the music.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, this is a tough one. The food is definitely solid food and I think it definitely warrants at least one Michelin star. I think of the 3 Michelin star territory as vaunted though, almost impossible to achieve. Flavors, presentation, etc are ones which you've never seen or tasted before or in a way that you've never seen before. To be honest, I never felt that during my entire meal. I thought the food tasted great and it was very well balanced, but nothing about any part of the meal really made me think differently about food. The best part of the meal to me was the uni and black truffle, and then one of the desserts which had amazing strawberries from Spain in them. The only thing it made me think about though was how I remember strawberries used to taste like this 25+ years ago and why they don't anymore. Another dish I really liked had some rice at the bottom and whatever it was around it tasted really great. Then I had this flashback to last year in China, and eating something that tasted similar down an alleyway for $2. I realized that yes it tastes great, but it's nothing really that unique compared to other places I've eaten around the world outside of the US. I'm even pretty sure I could find similar flavors as that dish in some restaurants in any large city at a very good ethnic restaurant. Good flavor, but when you realize this, there's some problems.\\n\\nThe service was very good here and I felt like we were very well taken care of by the entire staff. The drink pairings we were given were also great I feel so my level of respect for the staff is really up there.\\n\\nAll in all, my experience was very positive from start to finish. The food is very good and very well balanced. Is it worth a 3 star Michelin price though? I think back to previous 1 and 2 star meals I've had and the answer I'm coming up with is no - it's not. It's definitely Michelin quality but the food itself was not above other good 1 and 2 star Michelin restaurants I've eaten at. I would recommend someone who is big into food try this if they can swing it, but maybe only once.\\n\",\n",

Highly recommend it. \\n\\nSimply put, Meal of a life time.\\n\",\n",
       " \"As a disclaimer I don't even LOVE Japanese food, but this entire culinary experience was so amazing. We went for a friend's birthday celebration and were seated at the bar. Sitting at the bar itself is such a treat because you're able to watch everything happen as is - the chefs preparing the dishes from the very start to the waiters taking only a few steps to where you're seated to explain the next course. The ambiance was classy and formal but not too stiff. The kitchen and staff made it feel warm, as well as the restaurant itself not being too big a space to feel overwhelmed in. \\n\\nThe standout dishes for me were the poached langoustine, super buttery but not too creamy/heavy, the A5 wagyu, which melts in your mouth, the quail, which was very tender and sweet/tangy, and the crab, so springy and light. (I'm not a fan of raw/super fishy tasting foods - I know, I know - so while the uni and roe and caviar were mentioned throughout these reviews I can't speak to them properly. I did eat these! Just didn't enjoy as much as the above).\\n\\nThe dessert here is outstanding. I loved the shiso sorbet, super refreshing as one of the last courses and a cutting flavor without being overpowering to taste. The frozen almond soufflé was definitely interesting and tasty but the texture melted too quickly once it hit the tongue that I couldn't fully relish it. The yogurt with Malaga strawberries was my favorite - like an upscale froyo with the sweetest and juiciest strawberries - so simply yet so divine.\\n\\nWe didn't do a wine pairing but the couple next to us seemed to enjoy it and we noticed the sommelier was very attentive. Overall, great service, beautiful ambiance, lovely food.\\n\",\n",

I know this is hard, but why does every chef of multi-course menus leave an amazing piece of meat at the end when you are stuffed to the gills.

By the time we sat down at our table, Chef Ramirez politely greeted everyone at the table one by one and immediately went back to work with his team. \\n\\nNow onto the food: fanfuckentastic.

The ingredients are of very high quality, which means they do not need too much modification. However, each dish was still presented with finesse. \\n\\nWhy a 3 star review then? Because of the pacing. Usually in fine-dining establishments, I can eat at my own pace. But Chef's Table feels very forced. The food came at the pace of the kitchen and not the customers. I felt like I was forced to speed up my eating to keep up with the speed of the kitchen. So the experience became something less of a good meal and more of a chore. This should absolutely not be the case for the price of the meal. \\n\\nOverall, good spot, but would not go back again.\\n\",\n",

In fact, for me, NY has little to offer in the restaurant department.\\n\\nI was so excited to return to Brooklyn Fare today: this time to a pretentious, uptight atmosphere. I can't stand that. I stayed for 5 courses (little fish dishes) and a glass of champagne. I sent back two fish dishes because of the exact same sour flavor and got up to leave. I planned to pay the full price and not sit through this type of experience. \\n\\nThen I decided that I would sit through it to see if things would improve. A manager came over to me and graciously offered to refund all my money to me. They would not let me pay for the champagne. \\n\\nI was quite impressed by this gesture (which is rare in the US, but as it should be) and, although I wouldn't ever return, I can't write a bad review.\\n\\nSometimes it's best not to return to a place where you've had a stellar experience, but mostly, I find that it is.\\n\",\n",

The sea urchin, caviar, fluke and a couple others were great. Once they got to squab, wagyu beef, wild rice with foie, and frozen soufflé were just not great. The frozen soufflé really is more for fan fare- it's not sized for a tasting menu. It didn't have complex flavor or any build up. \\n\\nWaitstaff was good, they discuss the dishes but the whole experience is rushed and we could barely hear the description of dishes. \\n\\nAlso the menu they state is seasonal... but there are dishes on here that were on reviews from two years ago. The squab doesn't work... please take it off the menu. The soufflé has been shown on yelp and other reviews for years.. it just seems they lost their innovation. \\n\\nThe cost was slightly above 1000 dollars.

       " 'Do you visit a Michelin 3-Star restaurant ONLY for the food, or the ENTIRE experience? If it\\'s the latter, then Chef\\'s Table Brooklyn Fare is the biggest horseshit in the world.\\n\\nSo we thought we have completed visiting every 3-Michelin Star restaurant in Manhattan.  Found out Chef\\'s Table moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan; of course we were compelled to visit.\\n\\nSaturday, 7:30pm, table for four.\\n\\nBefore I begin, let me stress, this review is no way directed to ANY server or personnel at Chef\\'s Table.  Each and every one of them is personable, professional, courteous, and the establishment is lucky to have them all.\\n\\nThe concept of Chef\\'s Table is that this restaurant takes away all the traditional fanfare of an upscale restaurant experience to simply gather around chef\\'s kitchen and see/taste his creations.  I\\'m all for that; except this experience is not really that.  Somehow, I have a very different interpretation of \"communal\", and after visiting the six other 3-Michelin-Star restaurants (yes, I am still counting Daniel), I have certain expectations.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with dress code.  The restaurant REQUIRED that \"formal business attire\" be the dress code.  Let me paint this picture for you; you are in your formal business attire on a Saturday evening, perusing through a convenience store, squeezing yourself next to local tenants shopping in their tank-top and shorts.  Do I feel elegant; no, I look and feel like a schmuck.  The restaurant is located in the back of Mantena building\\'s convenience store.  Call it Brooklyn Fare, grocery store, wine cellar, whatever you want - it\\'s in the back of a convenience store.  I first thought the \"speakeasy\" type of entrance may be interesting.  It\\'s not.  It\\'s not because once you entered the restaurant, you realize it was probably once the stockroom for the convenience store.  Not much was \"converted\" making the transition; the ceiling was low, the décor was average, so you end up feeling exactly how someone would feel in his formal business attire walking into the stockroom in the back of a convenience store.\\n\\nEveryone was eager to help.  We were seated at undoubtedly the best table in the place; slightly elevated, but not at the counter.  Here\\'s the problem, we can\\'t see the chef or what he\\'s doing.  I don\\'t know if I want to be seated on the counter.  The place was uncomfortably warm and I can only imagine how even more uncomfortably hot it will be on the counter.  How do you not accommodate for the temperature in the room?\\n\\nThe place is loud, with what sounded like Q104 on the speakers.  Tell me again why am I dressed up in formal business attire to be here?\\n\\nNo real intro or narration as we were poured champagne to start the evening, and the first course was upon us.  Absolutely loved the tuna.  Sea urchin was a bit \"fishy\" since it\\'s simply fresh, but the generous portion of caviar quickly made up for this.  And when I say generous, it was probably three times the amount in other places.  Thank you, Chef.\\n\\nLangoustine was maddeningly delicious along with the crab meats, and the three proceeding fish dishes were the absolute best I have ever tasted.\\n\\nThe dessert dishes were quite plain.\\n\\nI was the only one at the table not with wine pairing.  I had a glass of champagne and a glass of rosé.  Again, I\\'m not a big wine drinker.  Wine somehow doesn\\'t enhance the flavor of food for me.  I actually prefer water with a meal as such.  My other three guests all enjoyed the wine paired with each dish.  My brother did commented that he expected more portions and selection from the pairing option.\\n\\nOne of our guests had to use the bathroom.  She was taken outside the restaurant to a locked room adjacent to the reception desk where she unlocked the door for her to use.  I did the same, and exited with another guest standing in the middle of the grocery store waiting to use the bathroom.  Is this really Michelin-3 standard?  I feel like I\\'m at a gas station waiting to use the bathroom.  Hey, I got an idea; if you need space, the Shell gas station on Westside Highway has space in its parking lot for you to convert it into a larger bathroom.  How about having a Bentley outside Mantena to shuttle everyone to and from this bathroom in a real 3-Michelin Star style?!\\n\\nChef César Ramirez is obviously a master in his craft.  I loved every dish.  He obviously can afford to upgrade EVERYTHING other than his cooking for the experience to be complete.  He simply chooses not to.  This experience, unfortunately, just wasn\\'t what I considered elegant, special, or any other metaphor you can think of to fully describe \"fine dining\", especially when the ingredients in our menu can be easily purchased by anyone at this convenience store.  $2,600 for four before tip wasn\\'t too outrageous, but bottom line is that if someone I cared about, whether they are my friends or family, ask me \"which 3-Michelin-Star restaurant in Manhattan would you recommend?\"  It is without a doubt NOT Chef\\'s Table.\\n',\n",

Any reservations about it being too posh or stuck up is quickly diffused by the charm and personality of the maître d who does a wonderful job in making you feel welcomed. \\n\\nNot being allowed to take pictures is an unwritten rule, since the chef doesn't want you to take away from the dining experience.

We knew what was ahead of us would be amazing. \\n\\nThe Japanese snapper with toasted rice was a one bite wonder. \\n\\nThe uni and shaved truffle with toast was one of the best things we had all night. \\n\\nThe chawanmushi was amazing.

       " \"KenScale: 9.0/10\\n\\nOut of all the top restaurants in New York, I've had the highest level of frustration booking a table at Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare. In its previous location in Brooklyn, the restaurant only accepted reservations via phone, and the line opens up at 10 a.m. every Monday for any spot in a given day 7 weeks out. Whenever I called, the line was busy, and by the time I got connected to the reservation line around, say, noon, all the tables were taken. I was giving up on trying my luck at the restaurant until I heard recently that the restaurant moved to the Brooklyn Fare location in Manhattan's Midtown West neighborhood, and a friend of mine who is a regular at the market was able to connect with a person who is in charge with taking care of reservations. To my shock, I had no problem getting a spot around 3 weeks out during prime time on a Friday evening, and was super excited to finally see what chef Cèsar Ramirez has been up to at his kitchen. The verdict: chef Ramirez's tasting menu (now up at $330 per person) certainly didn't disappoint and it should be one of the best fine dining destinations in the city. \\n\\nThe seafood-centric tasting menu at Chef's Table leans toward Japanese and I really loved the consistent level of clean flavor and emphasis on textural delight of each dish. I could tell that the kitchen is very meticulous when it comes to sourcing different seafood ingredients in various bite-sized starters that were rolled out, whether that's the pile of trout roe in the tartlet form, sea urchin from Hokkaido with a sheet of black truffle on top, or the white yellowtail accompanied by ginger and sunchoke pepper. Sea urchin was one of the freshest I've had in a while, and I still can't figure out what kind of magic the kitchen put together for the yellow tail with astounding level of balance in flavor and texture. Caviar that came on top of kabocha squash was pure bliss as well, and Norwegian king crab accompanied by apple and shiso was not only beautiful looking with flower petals on top but so memorably delicious with complexity of flavor as well. I'm not sure if I have had a grilled lobster as crunchy as the one that I've had at the Chef's Table in recent years, and the koshihikari rice submerged below black truffle displayed a ton of richness without somehow making me tired of it, and I indulged in every scoop of this marvelous dish. Compared to all the brilliant seafood dishes, the lone meat dish, Miyazaki wagyu, somewhat paled in comparison. The meat was expertly cooked to more or less perfect medium rare, but I kept wondering if the meat would've been better served with the sauce underneath that was rather strong in flavor. Following a refreshing scoop of grapefruit sorbet came a couple of outstanding dessert dishes. Soba chai ice cream with soy caramel had the nice hint of Japanese flavor, and my girlfriend and I couldn't stop raving about the frozen almond soufflé that was so wonderfully delicate that we had no problem finishing our share even though we were beyond stuffed by this time. Toward the end of the meal, chef Ramirez stopped by to check if everything was OK (he occasionally served dishes right in front of guests, such as the caviar) and graciously agreed to take photos with us. There has been some rumblings about chef Ramirez's demeanor in the press a couple of years ago, but I couldn't sense any of that in our brief interaction with him.\\n\\nI suspect the relative ease with which I was able to snag a spot was Chef's Table has to do with the fact that the Manhattan location now has tables outside of the kitchen counter that can serve additional diners. Guests who dine at 6 or 9 p.m. slots are expected to be seated at the counter, while those who dine in between (like us when we booked a spot at 7:30 p.m.) will be eating at the surrounding tables so if you want to have a counter tasting experience, make sure to book the time slots. There is a vast wine selection (many from France) from which you can select to complement your awesome meal. I can't compare the atmosphere of the Manhattan location to that in Brooklyn since I've been to the previous one before, but overall it was civilized vibe without the fuss of fine dining. I'm so glad that Chef's Table made a move to Manhattan (conversely, it marks the end of an era where Brooklyn used to have at least one three-Michelin star dining establishment) and would love to see how the food here evolves over time. The overall dining experience at Chef's Table certainly puts it at the top echelon of all the wonderful culinary spaces in the city.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Look, i've dined at most 3 star places in Manhattan and SF. \\n\\nThe food here is not 3 star food, it isn't even 1 star food. \\n\\nI could not believe how mediocre and bland most of the food was, it blew my mind!\\n\\nI would never go back. \\n\\nMaybe it was the move to Manhattan from Brooklyn? I do not know, but this experience was so poor that it made me question Michelin's entrenched sense of their 3 star picks.  \\n\\nI was talking to a dining-enthusiast couple next to me at the bar seating and they agreed they would never come back (we both had tried to get reservations for years).  \\n\\nREALLY DISAPPOINTING.\\n\",\n",

I would even compare it to Alinea in Chicago, which is the restaurant that is still #1 on my list! \\n\\nI really enjoyed the intimate bar seating, and Chef Cesar Ramirez himself greets everyone in the beginning. The French Japanese fusion is taste bud heaven explosion. Literally. The menu tends to start out being more skewed towards Japanese cuisine and the mains become more French influenced.

Chef Cesar Ramirez is back in the news with his Manhattan opening of Brooklyn Fare and the Chef's Table. With lots of offerings similar or reminiscent of what he had served previously in Brooklyn, Chef Cesar showcases his creativity and commitment to the art, complexity and joy of fine dining in a formal but casual setting. The addition of tables is new which is where you'd sit if you want to eat at a leisurely pace... plus there's only one seating per night at the table (versus two at the counter). The staff is concerned and observant to your needs and provides almost flawless customer service. Impressively each staff member appears positive and is engaging and makes an effort to converse, explain, and respond... including Chef Cesar himself.  \\n\\nThe multi course tasting highlighted primarily seafood from Japan - most memorable for me was the small pastry-like bite topped with trout roe to start with; the sea urchin on rice cake that followed; the king crab in a pepper reduction sauce; caviar; lobster with persimmon; short grain rice with truffles and sea urchin; and wagyu pieces. Dessert was interesting and included an almond soufflé that looks bigger than it is. It's got almost a cotton candy effect in your mouth and is not too sweet. \\n\\nEverything was unbelievably delicate, consistent, and fresh! The kitchen works hard and is in full view.

Really glad we came.\\n\\nFirst, they did a great job with the decor (ignore having to walk through the market -- it is no different than walking through Bubbledogs to get to The Kitchen Table in London) -- once you're through the door, you are in a different place.  We sat side by side at one of the tables.  We loved the space, the sight lines, and the music.  \\n\\nSecond, the staff was excellent and consistent with many of the other great reviews here.  Very attentive but not overbearing.  The somm was spot on for the two sake glasses I had before and after the Chablis we ordered.  The only nit was when they served each course, they tell you how the chef recommends you eat the dish.  My eyes and the utensils give it away -- I can figure it out for myself.\\n\\nFinally, and most importantly, the food was outstanding.  Every dish was inventive, flavorful and balanced.  A really good progression.  They said they added an abalone dish for us since we were in from CA -- if that was really true, it was a nice touch, plus it was great.  Some of the best sea urchin I have ever had.\\n\\nSince nothing is perfect, I had one issue -- there is only one bathroom for the whole place, which is back outside in the market.  I got up between courses, and I had to wait for several people in front of me.  They served the abalone course while I was out there -- my wife thought I had fallen in (you can imagine the texts).  They need to do something about that.\\n\\nOverall, very much worth the wait -- it made for a special evening.\\n\",\n",

He is funny, thoughtful and just an overall great person. I had the pleasure of speaking with him. He asked what I thought of the meal so far, which was my favorite, etc. I managed to get free mustard flower (b/c it was so damn delicious and I wanted to plant it in my yard). I also got his card which allows me to get special access to seating (not that I'm bragging but I am). Food is delicious. We got free drinks.

The new space is modern and nice. However, the chefs table is inauthentically big holding 18 spots.  It is far from the actually kitchen and involves literally zero interaction with the chefs expect for Chef Ramirez shyly asking a how the meal was. You can see some of the cooking but form the distance, not enough.  \\n\\nOur reservation was at 630 and despite our whole group arriving timely, we didn't get our first bite until 7.  Totally unacceptable.  The meal was too long, with very poor and varying pacing between dishes.  \\n\\nOverall, the food was ok, but it wasn't anything new. Frankly, a lot of the dishes were very similar and just downright boring. I don't need 3 pieces of fish in a row, basically looking the same with a slightly different sauce. The plating is perhaps the least imaginative I have ever seen at a 3 star restaurant. Portion sizes were small except for the a5.  Chef does play magically with complexity as flavors change from the the first to the last, going sweet to sour and lots of other combinations. The first two dishes were amazing, but it fell downhill from there fast. Dessert was an utter joke. Raspberries with ice cream and a molten chocolate cake topped with vanilla chocolate that was so lazily presented, I thought I was being trolled.\\n\\nThe ingredients are unique coming from small suppliers in Japan.

The sommelier was very nice and she let me try some and recommended by the glass. The food started nicely but ultimately ended up disappointing. The best dishes didn't require more or any cuisine or cooking, such as uni and truffle which was excellent. Or the Malaga strawberries and yogurt. The strawberries were fresh, and admittedly worked well with the yogurt. The exception to my critique, partially, was caviar with bell peppers and tomatoes. Again the caviar was not made by them of course, but worked well in the dish. The A grade wagyu was awful. It was gristle and just tasted like a chunk of fat. No melting in your mouth like I've had elsewhere, like Meadowwood. The langoustine dishes were very good though\\n\\nThe space is beautiful. The chef likes to wander around and see how things are going. Honestly, not sure how it got 3 stars. There are a few dishes that might be Michelin worthy. But for $400+ a person it was way over priced.\\n\\nI'll add that I made several dietary restriction requests, both prior to being there and reconfirmed at the restaurant, including no charcuterie.

I fell in love with this place at the first bite of the black truffle sea urchin, it simply melts in your mouth!

With only 30 guests on a Saturday night, I walked into Chef\\'s Table expecting a formal, intimate dinner.  But with such a friendly staff and a mood altering menu, they should rename the place to Chef\\'s Basement.  I almost felt guilty coming empty-handed.\\n \\nThe first bite was the highly anticipated sea urchin truffle.  If you have anything negative to say about this dish, I can think of something else to put in your mouth.  I was a little shocked to see the meal start off with a bang (perhaps Chef Ramirez was a Jeter fan).  For a split second, I questioned whether or not R-Money could exceed my expectations for two hours.  Let\\'s just call the first half of the menu \"The Godfather Part I\".  I won\\'t ruin your experience by overly detailing mine.  Plus, words can\\'t describe how unconventional the \"salad\" was.  If Princess Diana and Busta Rhymes shared a garden, this is what it would smell like.  Don\\'t be afraid to plunge your nose into every dish.  When you sit at the counter and watch Dr. Ramirez operate with tweezers, you\\'ll appreciate the finished product even more.  Rarely does a meal tackle all five senses.  More on this later.\\n \\nJust when I thought it couldn\\'t get any better, here comes the langoustine and wagyu (the Deniro and Pacino of grilled animals).  I hear pictures aren\\'t allowed but that didn\\'t stop people from snapping away.  If I\\'m gonna break the rules, I\\'d rather crash your dinner and steal the wagyu off everyone\\'s plate.  The suspense continued through dessert, which includes a generous portion of exotic strawberries.  This is where Cesar aka The Taste Czar solidified his Michelin dominance. \\n \\nI typically don\\'t do wine pairings.  So one of the servers was kind enough to drop by every few dishes to recommend sake or wine for my wife, while I stuck with a crisp Japanese beer I\\'ve never heard of.  I was even impressed by the selection of music playing in the background.  The Stones, Talking Heads, Steely Dan all provided the perfect soundtrack to my night.  I was celebrating a 6 year anniversary, and right on cue, Al Green made an appearance during dessert.  Chef Rizzy even has great taste in music.  Apologies to the people next to us if I was singing too loudly.\\n',\n",

A lot of fine dining multi course restaurants will always have fillers but every dish at chefs table was like a mini main course. It really deserves its 3 Michelin stars\\n\\nThe sommelier gave us awesome wines to choose from. She even recommended not to go with the wine tasting given how expensive it was and there being really good bottles we could choose from for a fraction of the price. \\n\\nAs you can expect, the service was perfect and the restaurant was clean and intimate given there's only a bunch of seats at the counter. We ended up even getting a picture with chef Ramirez!\\n\\nI will have to say that walking through a grocery store to get to the restaurant is a bit odd. And don't be late! They called us 2 minutes before our reservation and we were the last ones to arrive!\\n\\nDefinitely as good as if not better than eleven Madison and my other favorite, atera.

       " \"This review is for a dinner on January 17, 2017 soon after they moved to midtown manhattan. The food was amazing as expected. I don't understand people who rate this restaurant poorly based on getting exactly what the restaurant is known for. If you don't want a mostly seafood tasting menu then you shouldn't go here. Each course was masterfully prepared and attention to detail is a huge understatement. The entire staff quietly and expertly move through the kitchen like a choreographed production. It was impressive to watch. As for the opinion of some that the chef does not like Asian people, that wasn't our experience. Many of the restaurant's patrons were Asian (we are not), the chef seemed to spend equal time with everyone. The chef did not spend time with the couple (who were not Asian) immediately to our left who were texting on their phones throughout the entire meal. Food in one hand, phone in the other for almost 3 hours. While I've heard photos aren't allowed no one said anything when I quickly and discreetly took a panoramic of the kitchen and staff. Our phones were put away for the rest of the evening except for a quick glance below the table to make sure our kids hadn't killed each other or burned the house down. I wished they offered a wine pairing with the meal. They don't but can suggest wines at different intervals. I accepted the offer but was only served two wines throughout the meal. I prefer a small pour for each course as I've experienced elsewhere. Why 4 stars? There wine list is understandably expensive and we ordered one the least expensive bottles of champagne ($140) that was served warm. I should've sent it back as soon as they allowed us to taste it but instead I requested they pour just a little and do what they could to get a cold quickly. They assured us they would but most of the bottle was consumed while warm and it was disappointing. Two separate staff members blamed the temperature of their cellar, which one said was unusually warm today. (It was winter in NY with seasonally appropriate weather.)\\n\",\n",
       " \"This review is long overdue. I went when it was still in Brooklyn. By far this was the most unforgettable meal I've ever had. It brought a tear to my eyes.

I can only say that \"my palate has never experienced so much joy\"!!! It may sound a little strange, but the only way I can describe it is to say: It was like music with one course building on the next in a wave that was extraordinarily harmonious with one another... The wines they paired for us went perfectly with each course. Chef Ramirez and his entire team were very helpful and personable throughout the entire service. I have had other 3 star chef\\'s tasting menus but I have to say there is absolutely no comparison! Cesar Ramirez you are an incredible chef and a true artist. I am so happy I had the opportunity to dine with you and your incredible team! Cheers to all of you!!!\\n',\n",
       " \"Up to date, I have been to Chef's Table 8 times already. I have read a lot of comments so far. It seems pretty interesting that people either hate it to death or love it like crazy. There is rarely in between reviews. I believe the main reason may be the nature of its very special concept.\\n\\nIngredients - I am totally a sushi lover. So of course Chef's Table using fish, uni, wagyu and etc. imported directly from Japan won my heart in the first place. Additionally, about the choice of ingredients, the chef has an eye of top-tier Japanese sushi chefs. \\nHere is the proof. Chef's table provides pretty much the top-tier kinds of seasonal fish that we can import to US with very high and consistent quality, such as managatsuo (butterfish), kinmedai (golden eye snapper), akamutsu/nodoguro (black throat sea perch), kasugo-dai (baby snapper), saba (Japanese mackerel), and also Hokkaido Bafun Uni. Besides, their permanent dish includes Miyazaki A5 wagyu steak, which is also the top level steak from Japan.\\n\\nCooking - If you know Japanese food very well and you like Japanese food, you'd probably love Chef's Table. I saw people speaking ill of their nearly rare fish dishes. Here is the thing, if you do not typically eat rare fish or sushi, this restaurant is not your type. The chef incorporated a lot of Japanese concepts in his cooking, including one of my favorite tricks, which is using charcoal to sear the fish skin. Sushi fish in high quality shall have high percentage of fat. So the heat from the charcoal can melt some fat and make the fish more flavorful and oily. The smoky scent from the charcoal also adds up. At the same time, the major part of the fish will not be cooked too much and is able to maintain portion of its fat and soft texture.\\nBesides fish, the chef also knows well how to cook meat. I've had wagyu, lamb, and pigeon during the past. Wagyu is always cooked perfectly at relatively low temperature, which is best for fatty steak like wagyu. Considering all the wagyu I had at Chef's Table, I couldn't say lamb and pigeon can give the restaurant extra stars, but they were still very impressive compared to most the tasting menus I have tried over the years.\\n\\nAs many people may know, their truffle uni brioche is one of the major reasons that keep people returning to the restaurant. So I will not once again say too much about that. Most recently, I had the chance to try another truffle uni course, the winter dish - white truffle uni risotto. It was amazing. Actually, such dish is very famous in Japan. Japanese people love the pasta or risotto to be cooked with sweet bafun uni and covered by a thick layer of shaved white truffle. Now I found a pretty good one in US. Maybe because I used to go to Chef's Table in early spring and late summer at the very beginning, I did not even know this dish was on the menu in every white truffle season.\\n\\nFor me, this is my favorite restaurant in NY, but not necessarily to be yours. After all, I think eating is a very personal thing. No matter how a restaurant is doing, there are always patrons who are addicted to it and for sure some people who cannot love it or even just hate it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Finding the restaurant is not so simple. It is at the back of the Brooklyn Fare Grocery store in the middle of a desolate block. \\n\\nThe restaurant inquired to see if we were celebrating a special occasion which we disclosed but the restaurant never acknowledge them so I am not sure why they bothered to ask?\\n\\nThe restaurant has changed some of their ridiculous policies which is a good thing. We were initially told that we could not make a reservation for three because the restaurant only accommodated even numbered parties. We could have a single person join us if were only three people? Really at $330 per person we are going to have some random person join our celebratory family dinner? It is preposterous that that a single parent was unable to dine with their two adult children. The restaurant shortly after my initial inquiry changed its policy although the website still says that seatings are offered for two or four.\\n\\nThe photograph policy also appears to have changed since the restaurant told me there were no issues taking photographs. \\n\\nOdd rumors that the chef \"hates on Asians\" seems bizarre since half the clientele was Asian, some of the servers are Asian and the food has an Asian slant. \\n\\nThe chef is present in the kitchen and greets all the diners which is really nice since so many starred chefs are awol. He warmly greeted us and all the diners throughout the meal. He even served the caviar course.\\n\\nThe restaurant\\'s acoustics are impressive especially in the alcoved tables. It was wonderful to dine and actually be able to hear the conversation. Other restaurants should take note. \\n\\nBut there were issues. The meal was slow to start. We didn\\'t receive anything to eat until we sat there for about 20-minutes. We finally asked if they had forgotten us and at another point asked if the pace could be picked-up since we were hungry. \\n\\nWe never received a menu nor were we given any choice about anything we ate. A menu is not available online. We were solely asked if we had any allergies or food issues. But we had no idea how many courses there were, what we would be eating nor what we ate after we were orally told what was on our plate. It was odd. It\\'s impressive that some clients can remember what they accurately ate without tape recording the server. I like a menu to help me pace myself and to follow along and at a minimum after the meal. The food was delicious and the ingredients unusual which made not having a menu even more frustrating since there were so many unfamiliar elements. \\n\\nAs tasty as each course was, the three of us were unimpressed.  For a meal that costs $330/pp not including taxes but excluding service, there was no \"wow factor\" like I have experienced at other comparable restaurants such as  Blue Hill at Stone Barns, Eleven Madison, Fat Duck or Alinea. Something was missing from the evening. Frankly, Olmsted in Brooklyn was more impressive for a fraction of the price. Most of the dishes relied too heavily on the unusual or expensive ingredient rather than being impressive on their own. \\n\\nThe frozen soufflé was the one unusual dish whose tastes changed as the dessert melted but its appearance was rather blah looking. \\n\\nThe predominance of the meal was fish and seafood with only one course of Wagu beef. The warm potato bread that accompanied the meat was incredible and tasted like a latke. We asked for a second roll. The server hesitated since the rolls were made for the exact number of diners. She brought one additional roll to the table. We didn\\'t realize that we each needed to request an additional roll so we shared it like paupers.\\n\\nThe presentation of two petite fours signaled the meal was done and I mean finished. The meal abruptly ended since the bill is prepaid so a check isn\\'t proffered unless beverages are ordered, a menu isn\\'t presented and there is no parting take-away gift. We were suddenly dismissed and felt like we should immediately leave so we did. Prior to our departure, we were told that the restaurant offered a new service that enabled guests to make a return reservation if they made it prior to exiting. Tacky doesn\\'t even begin to describe how this sounded to us and we have no desire to return for a meal that was less than exciting at this price.\\n',\n",
       " \"One of the best restaurant experiences I've been a part of! The private and secluded entrance in the back of the grocery store was intriguing to start. Sitting at the large bar and seeing the gorgeous kitchen run like clockwork was breathtaking. The dishes were prepared and plated within viewing distance and delivered promptly. The timing and execution were impeccable! I can't say enough as to how good the flavors and textures were. The plates were very easy to consume (both physically and visually), but the depth of flavor leaves you amazed! The uni, lobster, caviar, fish, chocolate flan dishes were top notch!

An hour plus of that plus being on hold for 20 minutes, I finally break through. I have no idea who Im going with but Im going damn it!\\n\\nCut to 6 weeks later and Im literally flying from Heathrow in London to JFK to make this dinner. A few weeks prior, I experienced the not awesomeness of London\\'s full on Tube Strike which blew out one of my other flights. Luckily that didnt happen but it didnt stop my flight from getting in late. Shoot. Then I have to fight NYC traffic into downtown Brooklyn. I get to my hotel, shower and immediately jump on the F train north. I make it just in time but my friend gets caught up coming down from Williamsburg. Shoot we miss the first course which is a small sliver of mackerel Im sad but the rest of the dinner calms us and we just enjoy a ride.\\n\\nAs many of you know, you dont get a menu, you dont get to take pictures, and it\\'s Chef Ramirez\\'s game all the way. You are submissive when you decide to take on this meal. A series of small seafood bites pepper the initial offerings, some wagyu beef, and a number of desserts. It\\'s hard to remember the whirlwind of food. It\\'s smart that they seat half the space first then the other half about 45 min later and on this night there\\'s only one seating but I know that other days they have a second. David the wine director was nice enough to send me the pairings he\\'d setup for me:\\n\\nDomaine Fosse Seche, Saumur, Arcane, Loire Valley 2011\\n \\n Domaine Henri Germain, Meursault, Burgundy 2011\\n \\nMaxime Magnon, Corbieres, \\'Campagnes\\', Languedoc 2010\\n\\nIm guessing if I were more anal about it I could have begged for the menu. However it was more interesting to be totally surprised and see if anything stood out. Now everything was wonderful but Im not sure there was anything the blew my mind. Am I a \"jaded feedbag\" as Bourdain would say? It was still a stellar meal nonetheless. I do remember something, the sea salt that they use is the same that I use at home! Who knew I was using 3* Sea Salt! \\n\\nService is very tight and focused and they only seem to chat with some of the regulars. Interestingly enough, the guy next to me from Memphis has eaten here a half dozen times. So how do you approach a Brooklyn based Mexican chef? Bring your own Brooklyn based Mexican chef! once my friend and chef Ramirez switched over to Spanish it was a million miles and hour and I could only pick up tidbits of the conversation. But it was cool to see two chefs talk shop and theory. \\n\\nAfter that, I said good bye to my friend and immediately went back to the hotel and crashed on my mind\\'s UK time zone. Id definitely like to go back but, next time it will be under less stressful circumstances.\\n',\n",
       " 'Three Michelin-starred, and rightfully so! Literally one of the most amazing meals I\\'ve ever had in my 27 years of life haha :) And from what I can see, the controversy from 2014 was all fabricated-I\\'m Asian and I had a fantastic time! Chef Ramirez was also as hospitable as can be, chatting with us at times when he was free. My boyfriend surprised me here for our 2-year anniversary, how\\'d I get so lucky? :)\\n\\nA true chef\\'s table with only 18 seats around a U-shaped counter with an open kitchen. There\\'s staggered seatings (I think this happens with both their 7pm and 10pm but I\\'m not 100% sure), the left side of the room starts around 7pm, and the right side of the room starts around 7:45pm. We got to sit in the two seats on the very left side, basically right next to the kitchen where you can see everything being made up close and personal!\\n\\nThere\\'s one main guy who serves you most of your dishes from this little trapped area between the kitchen and counter (occasionally Chef Ramirez will place a plate in front of you!) - Raymond was great the entire night, explaining the dishes and also occasionally exchanging some witty banter lol. For the first few plates, the decadent bites were quite large, but every time, he came by to tell us with a smile, \"this is a ONE BITE...\" I wish I could savor the food with more bites, but they really are packed with flavor if you eat everything all together!\\n\\nHere\\'s how I remember the dishes:\\n\\nTrout Roe Tartlet\\nOh man...what a good start to the meal! They pack on as much trout roe as they can fit onto the tartlet, which is quite a lot for one bite! Umami attackkkk!\\n\\nHokkaido uni toast with black truffle\\nUh, how could the meal get any better than this? Again, this toast is packed with pieces of fresh and plump uni and brushed over with a special sauce and topped with a piece of black truffle. ONE BITEEEEEEE. One can never have too much uni :D\\n\\nJapanese snapper with crispy rice skin\\nSo simple and elegant, just a thin piece of snapper with a whimsical crispy rice skin (imagine rice krispies but obviously much more refined and round). Such a good textural contrast between the tender snapper and crispy skin, a theme I see and thoroughly enjoyed throughout the meal!\\n\\nPerch in shiso sauce\\nI wish Chef Ramirez sold this amazing shiso sauce in a jar...I would snatch up as many as I can. Perch was also made perfectly.\\n\\nKaluga caviar atop a dashi sabayon\\nThis is the epitome of decadence. Chef Ramirez spoons on almost half a tin of caviar for each person! Below the dashi sabayon, there were these amazing crunchy bits (I asked and they told me these were deep fried potatoes, ammaazzingg), onions I think, and what tasted like smoked salmon. AHHHHH.\\n\\nPoached lobster with rutabaga\\nI don\\'t usually even like lobster, but this was poached to perfection. The rutabaga on top cut the richness, which I liked.\\n\\nCod\\nAll the fish were made amazingly well. This one was so tender you could probably cut it with a feather haha. I think this dish also had a miso paste on the bottom?\\n\\nMushroom broth chawanmushi with king crab, oyster, foie gras, truffle, mushrooms\\nAnother stand-out dish! My boyfriend wouldn\\'t stop raving about it after he took his first bite. I don\\'t know if this actually had any egg in it, but what replaced it was probably better, what we think was the foie gras! The oysters tasted amazingly fresh, even though it was in a hot broth. \\n\\nWinter Vegetables\\nThey took so much care making and plating this dish; With tweezers, they carefully placed each piece of veggie and edible flower and presented us a work of art. I would happily be a vegetarian if this was what vegetarian food tasted like everywhere :)\\n\\nMiyazaki Wagyu Beef\\nI actually thought this was too fatty for my liking, maybe this was a piece towards the side? Def melted like butter though!\\n\\nSquab and Tamago (made of brioche)\\nHe got creative with the Tamago and created his version using brioche instead (didn\\'t taste like egg, so we asked him about it!).\\n\\nFinger Lime Sorbet with Grapefruit Caviar\\nThe grapefruit caviar gives a pop of flavor everytime you take a bite. So amazed.\\n\\nSoba Ice Cream\\nWhere else do they sell this?! If I had tubs of this at home, I\\'d probably gain a ton of weight since I\\'d eat a pint daily! The faint flavor of soba/buckwheat was to die for! Not too sweet either.\\n\\nWhite Chocolate Frozen Soufflee\\nLike eating a cloud!!! Disappears once you put itin your mouth. Ours had a dusting of matcha.\\n\\nWe also got wine pairings (4 glasses); these were all pretty great - 2 whites, 1 red, and 1 dessert wine. The glasses are bottomless throughout the duration of that specific pairing, so enjoy! Sommelier was super attentive.\\n\\nAt the end of our meal, they put a cute mini candle in front of us to congratulate us on our 2-yr anniversary, how sweet :) If I were a billionaire, I would definitely be here weekly. But for now, once in a blue moon will do!\\n\\n*Tip: No note-taking, no pictures!!!\\n*Tip: Jackets required\\n',\n",

I'm not filming you, I'm not recreating your food in my mind, I'm trying to remember what I ate. When there is someone actively going around telling you it is disrespectful to the chef to take notes, that is drawing the line. Bruh, your food was decent.

Luckily, the day I wanted was available. \\n- Only one bathroom for all patrons (leading to lineups in the grocery store if you need to use the restroom) \\n- Pacing of courses were not consistent - sometimes the wait was quite long between each course, though the meal ended precisely 2.5 hours after it started \\n- They specifically ask when you make the reservation if it is for a special occasion (it was for a birthday), but it is never acknowledged during the experience (no mention from servers, no small offering at the end of the meal) \\n- We had a reservation for 6:30 and were seated on the half of the counter with other 6:30 guests. The other half of the counter consisted of the 6:00 guests, who all obviously finished their meal earlier. Once those guests started to leave (and since everyone with the same seating time gets served the same thing, at the same time, all these guests left at the same time) the dining room started to lack ambiance as it was like dining in a half empty restaurant\\n\\nAll in all, we still had a great time and loved our exquisite meal. However, for a restaurant of this calibre (and at this price point), finessing the tiny kinks would really knock this out of the ballpark.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Yummy, but tooo expensive for little amounts of food. Waiters and waitresses are ok. Welcome you with a dull, but welcoming smile. They aren't cheerful, but that's not a bad thing\\n\",\n",
       " \"I went here and did the tasting menu. It was delicious and the service was impeccable, but I don't think it's worth 3 Michelin stars. One of the servers almost poured another party's wine into our glasses multiple times. The presentation was good, but I was expecting more of a show.\\n\",\n",

       " \"No photo is allowed, and you will have to wear jacket to enter this place, however this is still the best dinner I have ever had on this planet, no exaggeration at all.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes, among its great selection of tasting, were the uni and lobster. The secret sauce on top of uni probably served the purpose of marinating flavor. Their beef, on the other hand, was also a signature dish, as the meat was cooked medium rare and was soft enough to flow in your mouth. As a dessert follower, I would also strongly recommend their sorbet with strawberry and cake that was able to melt itself in your mouth. It was really a difficult task to pick my most favorite dish.\\n\\nI do not know others' experience, but I was calling more than 100 times just to secure my table. In this particular case, having an Amex card on hand was probably a great idea as they could assist in making reservations. However I would emphasize that having dinner here was not only about eating great food, but also about having an experience in fine dinning that's gonna permanently change your way of judgment. \\n\\nIt was a three Michelin star by the way, I foresee it very difficult, if even feasible, to surpass!\\n\",\n",
       " 'If I could give this place all the stars in the world I would. This dining establishment puts all other \"fine dining\" restaurants to shame. If you go to Per Se or Le Bernadin what is the likelihood that Thomas Keller or Eric Ripert is back there plating the food?! Now imagine you are having dinner with the genius himself in front you actually creating the masterpieces?! All this and more happens at Chef\\'s Table at Brooklyn Fare. \\n\\nIt\\'s starts off with a call. Actually in my case 212 to be exact to get two of the eighteen seats on a Wednesday night. The day finally arrives. We come a few minutes early and sit on the bench a few feet down from the restaurant when we notice someone gesturing to us to come in, it\\'s Cesar Ramirez himself. He greets us with a warm smile and a firm handshake. We\\'re seated in the first two seats nearest to him. He is literally serving each dish and on occasion chatting with us about food, life and travel. He couldn\\'t have been more genuine or kind. Not at all did I once feel discriminated against. (And let me just add that I looked at the dishes of the Caucasian women next to me, her pieces were just as equal to mine). \\n\\nThe FOOD. Oh my Lord in heaven.....what words can be used to describe such decadence?! Such flavor?! Such innovation?! I don\\'t know how to describe each dish but only to say it was sheer perfection. There is no menu and no photos allowed so the only memories I have are the ones ingrained in my head. All the dishes were spectacular. It was a progression that simply got better and better. I remember the uni with truffle on brioche. The cod which was roasted to perfection. And the most generous portion of caviar EVER! \\n\\n\\nThis was the single most incredible dining experience I will ever have. It was worth every penny.\\n',\n",
       " \"We're a stranger to other 3 Michelin star spots but this was, without a doubt, the best meal of our lives. \\n\\nWent here for my girlfriend and myself two year anniversary. The place is simple, not your overly extravagant establishment with a single large island that seats everyone, next to an open kitchen. We heard that this place could be geographically hard to find (it's not), so we tried to show up extra early to ensure we weren't late. Maybe it's because we were the first to show up for our seating, or we were serendipitously assigned so, but we were seated closest to the kitchen which allowed us to chat with some of the chefs and prime seats at seeing them make everything; a show almost as good as the food itself. \\n\\nThe food and service were both on point, and while it was both the best meal we've ever eaten, it was also the most expensive. On balance though we wholeheartedly recommend it for any special occasion, and look forward to returning.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I have been to all 3 stars michelin restaurants in US. And chef's table at brooklyn fare is simply the best!\\n\",\n",
       " \"This has been a long time coming. \\n\\nMy wife and I live close enough that Brooklyn Fare is our local grocery store. I've literally been in the adjacent space hundreds and hundreds of times, but the Chef's Table was always a bit out of reach. \\n\\nThe folks we sat next to mentioned that this was their ninth visit to the only Brooklyn restaurant to receive Michelin's highest honor; while I continue to hope that we'll one day magically find ourselves in their tax bracket, in the real world, for people like us, this extravagant meal can only be attempted on a special occasion. Hell, the bottle of wine we got (which was on the very, very low end of their impressive list) cost us as much as dinner would at most of our regular spots. \\n\\nBut recently the stars aligned. My wife was celebrating an important birthday,* and we were able to score a reservation. So we went. \\n\\nPlease keep in mind that Chef Ramirez doesn't allow photography or note-taking. Although I'm of the opinion that for this amount of money I should be allowed to rub the sous chef's head for good luck if that's what I want to do, I am nothing if not obedient. I do think my quick, non-flash photography would be far less intrusive than the loud, crapulent (what an amazing word) ladies across the way...but I'm hanging out in my glass house over here so I'll keep my mouth shut. In any case, you're stuck with my incomplete, wine-addled memory. But what I do remember was remarkable. \\n\\nFor starters, the service was perfection. Both the cooks and the servers move like in concert like well-oiled machines, with very few wasted motions. They cook, and plate, and garnish, and serve, and clear, all with a practiced efficiency that adds up to fairly perfect pacing. The rubber doilies that are placed between each soiled dish are emblematic of the service as a whole; everything is intelligently conceived to ensure that we, the diners, have the best possible experience. You never hear the clank of a plate. And the plates themselves! In one presentation, powerful magnets keep a small bowl of caviar upright on an angled stand. A bite of mackerel was served atop a porcelain pedestal. The stemware is the finest you'll ever use, and it all almost makes you feel like the money you spent is on display.\\n\\nOf course, the food. The food. With over twenty, I can't recall each individual course. I happily lost count as I enjoyed the sheer variety and quality of the bites, and of course, the company of my middle-aged wife.** But nearly all were memorable. \\n\\nThe foie gras served in a dashi with ramp custard rivaled the sea urchin accompanied by a generous slice of black truffle for the best bite of the evening...but there were many that were not far behind. The black cod was buttery, the turbot elegant, the sea perch shockingly tender. The gorgeous duck was a revelation with morels and an onion cream, and the wagyu was actual wagyu (not the gristley bits your Murray Hill Applebee's clone passes off in their sliders)...it melted into unctuous joy inside my mouth, with the barest modicum of chewing. \\n\\nNever a sweet tooth, I was nevertheless amazed by each and every dessert course. We started with a perfectly palate cleansing shiso sorbet, followed by an exceptional yogurt, rhubarb, and sake geleé. I don't understand the green tea with milk chocolate concoction that melted away like cotton candy as soon as you put it in your mouth, but I liked it. The meyer lemon cookie was as good as cookies can be, and the last bite, a gooey soy caramel that burst forth through the thinnest layer of chocolate, it could've been the best of them all.\\n\\nWas it a perfect meal? No. Some combinations were not as successful as others. The lobster was underdone for my liking, and the abalone moved past forgettable into unappetizing. But the overall effect was magnificent.\\n\\nIs it worth it for you to dine here? I can't answer that for you. It's a lot of money, and that cash could translate into six or seven meals at quality restaurants or, you know, rent. But I'm certainly happy I went. I think you will be too. \\n____________\\n\\n*Doesn't she look good for 50?\\n**Don't kill me lady, I'm just kidding.\\n\",\n",

This small size and setting create an incredible atmosphere: you feel part of an exclusive epicurean club solely focused on food and celebrating the moment. \\n\\nExecution was perfect, and wine selection was mind blowing.

An intimate coalescence between Japanese and French cuisine, Chef Ramirez brings you to a place that connects you to food once again, and reminds you how you fell in love with your tastebuds. \\n\\nAs I arrived, farther from Manhattan than my typical faring, my date and I were ushered in by none other than the chef himself making casual small talk about food and other worldly things. The mood, casual, with an air of refinement, fitting for having been seated so openly with eighteen or so other strangers.\\n\\nEverything from the decorum to the wine pairings were thought out and intentional. I was afraid this would be an ostentatious hibachi grill type setup, but the staff moved with purpose and attention to detail. \\n\\nWith so many courses though, it was easy to receive a plate that was underwhelming and forgettable, but also easily redeemed by how well the fish was prepared.

They only take reservations via phone 6 weeks out, so you better plan ahead! \\n\\nthe ATMOSPHERE\\nThey say they have a formal dress code (coat for the men, etc.), but I saw people there in t-shirts, so they are not strict on their policy. The name \"Chef\\'s Table\" says it all. We were seated at a long semi-circle table in front of the kitchen, where we could see the chefs preparing the food. It was a great experience to see the food execution and to interact briefly with the top chef as he walked around the room making sure everyone was enjoying their food. The staff was on point, from wine pairings to wiping up every minuscule drip from my water glass. I loved the casual atmosphere from this up-scale place. The only negative is that the room got very hot! The stove/burner they were using apparently went up to 1000 degrees and it was the dead of summer, but it would have been nice if the place was a bit cooler!\\n\\nthe FOOD\\nPerfectly executed with unique textures and flavors. This was a treat for me since I don\\'t usually get to eat caviar or truffle! They were really able to show case their techniques when they prepared a white fish in 3 different ways: battered and fried, poached (i think) with saffron, and in a ravioli. Everything was so delicious! My favorite was the souffle, which melted in your mouth! In preparation they whip the cream and then immediately freeze to achieve the light and airy texture! Amazing!\\n\\nDEFINITELY RECOMMEND!\\n',\n",

After a chat with him, I learned that he was  married to a French Brittany wife, taking  his two summer weeks vacation like us regular guys, without mentioning his big shot New York Chef status when traveling... \\n\\nThe concept is basically like watching a cooking show live at a few feet distance, except that you get to eat the food and most likely be blown away.\\n\\nThe high-tech and greatly designed opened kitchen is truly functional and set like a theater stage, definitely not a housewife\\'s one. The Nippon utensils, rare hand-crafted knifes, ultra nec copper pans and unique crock-ware, meticulously used are all imported from Europe and Japan, so is the crystal glassware($$$ Austrian Zalto )\\n\\nAll the seafood is from tsujikii market in Tokyo as well as Chuo kobe beef from the Tajiima breed straight from Japan , not American Wagyu, the duck they serve is the delicate female Moulard, specially raised  for top restaurants in the country. Servings considering the costs are very generous and noble ingredients like foie gras, truffles, abalone, caviar, gold leaves are used in the fusion Japanese/French style of cooking. What actually shocked me was the fat gargantuan spoonful of Osetra Caviar that topped one of their uni sabayon dishes. \\n\\nNeedless to say, his tasting menu formula is probably the best of what you will get in the city and reasonably expensive but not ridiculous over the roof prices from places like Masa or Per Se . \\n\\nService is run mostly by female staff which balances out the all male kitchen, the seamless pace of the meal is designed to continuously stimulate your taste-buds and is performed flawlessly.

       " \"Oh where to even begin on this one?\\n\\nThere are few restaurants out there where your meal is more than a meal, and becomes a dining experience. This is one of them.\\n\\nTo get a reservation, you have to call at 10:30 on the Monday 6 weeks in advance of the week you want to come. You will get a busy signal over and over. You will put your name on the waiting list and never get a call. One day, if you are persistent, you will get your reservation. \\n\\nThe restaurant is a bar with a kitchen behind it. It is modern and immaculately clean and sleek and sexy. There are 3 seating each night, consisting of 8 people in total. 24 people per night, and that's it, and that is why it is impossible to get a reservation here.\\n\\nThere were probably around 25 courses, and was almost entirely seafood. There were a number of sashimi dishes, but not what you get at any sushi place. Each piece is expertly paired with various foams, gelées, crusts, extracts, oils, and various other delectable goodies, many of which you have never seen or heard of. Every single bite is tender, melt in your mouth, and well balanced. There were a few cooked mains (turbot, scallops with abalone, and duck breast with morel mushrooms) that were all excellent. They give you some warm, crusty bread with dinner. Resist the urge to eat it on its own, and use it to soak up all of the deliciousness on the plate. \\n\\nThe absolute star of the meal for me: brioche with uni and black truffle - this is the most amazing, rich, decedent thing I have ever had. You don't even want to swallow it.\\n\\nThere were probably a good 4-5 desserts, including one that screams of molecular gastronomy and just messes with your head. \\n\\nThe staff here is superb. We got there about 45 minutes early for the 6:30 seating and while they were still setting up, we told the hostess / sommelier we wanted to sit as far to the left as possible to be close to the kitchen, and she happily obliged. Each dish was explained in great detail of each ingredient and its preparation. The wines were likewise described in great detail from the origins of the region and winery to the tasting notes and how they pair with the dishes. \\n\\nWe added the 7 glass wine tasting to the meal, which I highly recommend doing. Each wine is perfectly paired with the courses they come out against, and all of the wines have great legs to them. We asked if it was 7 full glasses, and were told that they were half pours, but in reality, they were much more than that and generous, so make sure you don't have any drinks before hand because it does catch up with you.\\n\\nSo my overall take on this? Phenomenal food, and I cannot say a negative word towards anything I ate there or the service or the ambiance. That being said, this place is super, super expensive. The meal runs $225 a person, plus 20% tip plus tax. Throw in the 7 glass wine pairing at $150 a person, plus tax plus tip, and a dinner for two is going to run you about $1000. The dinner  itself, I'd say you are paying $75 for the food itself, $75 to be at the chef's table, and $75 for the exclusivity of it and to say that you have been there.\\n\\nSo despite the expense, would I do it all again and pay for it all over? Abso-freaking-lutely.\\n\",\n",

It tasted amazing. \\n\\nI was dissapointed that it was given 10 courses in and showcased the talents of the chef\\'s team, while every other dish seemed half-assed in comparison.\\n\\nLets talk about dessert, their Frozen Souffle. The most disappointing thing you will ever eat. \\n\\nThey present you with a massive souffle that looks like a huge muffin... Massive in size... Your mouth is watering... You dig in.. Wow it  breaks apart just like a real cake... You take a piece and put it in your mouth... and it disappears into nothing! \\n\\nHa! This dish was designed to liquidate into nothing as soon as you put it into your mouth!\\n\\nWorse then eating air.\\n\\nI told them it was my birthday when I booked, when I confirmed and directly to the Chef before the meal. At the end I got nothing. A few other tables got tiny bowls with lit candles to celebrate - which was already kinda of lame - but the fact that I was not even acknowledged was really odd. Perhaps its because i LOOKED Asian? I mean I\\'ve heard this guy hates Asian people. Google it.\\n\\nSo overall, this place was just OK.\\n\\nOn that note, if you were a chef that HATED Asian people, why the hell would you open a Japanese themed restaurant?\\n\\nBTW. I noticed the corner seats closest to kitchen were BAD - next to the stoves where heat and smoke blasted out across the room, and just by \"coincidence\" the ASIAN couple was seated there. \\n\\nI read that this place literally got its stars because the French Michelin director ate here and liked it. The chef seems to have ZERO credentials and ZERO articles about his cullinary past online\\n\\nAlternatively, I\\'d suggest the $85 tasting menu at Degustation in East Village for an almost identical experience, or just spend the same $600 on food there to buy the ENTIRE MENU \\n\\nSo, if you HAVE to spend $250+ for a Michelin menu, here\\'s my grades in order of best to worst:\\n\\nEleven Madison Park A\\nBrooklyn Fare C\\nMomofoku Ko D+\\nLe Bernardin F\\nSemilla F\\n',\n",

A very uncomfortable chair surrounding an island, where the lone staff felt more like a fish in a very small fish bowl than a real human being, has to deal with patrons all by herself. I mean ALL BY HERSELF. \\n\\nEnter that particular evening\\'s Prima Donna, who screamed and yelled about the lack of announcement of dairy in the preparation. If she was having an epileptic reaction, it\\'s one thing, it\\'s not. She inhaled the bread and the lobster, while complained about them being prepared with butter. To calm her down, they brought free wine for the couple and a redo of a lobster, everything intact but the dollop of buttery sauce on top. She inhaled that as well. As it turned out, she was not really allergic to it, she ate the ice cream just fine.\\n\\nI recall reading a review somewhere that says, \"the chef is good, the kitchen staff is great, but be aware of fellow patrons.\" No shit! I must hit the jack pot on running into a jack ass, who happened to be sitting right next to me. Lucky lucky me for flying out three thousand miles for a very expensive birthday dinner only to have to deal with this. Thomas Keller probably would have booted her out of the door.\\n\\nThe restaurant, mind you, is very small. It\\'s literately a chef\\'s table. Seating is 18 people, they are impossible to book, six weeks in advance and then you have to have a party of 2 or 4, good luck if you are alone and want to dine here, it\\'s not going to happen. For my special evening, in addition to having to listen to the screamer next to me, I was sufficiently bored. So I got to check out other patrons, most of the folks are out of the country. A Joan River look alike woman from Italy also had her fair share of special requests, thus rather entertaining to watch. The social pecking order of the restaurant dining bares it all when you are dining in such an intimate setting. Reviews had said that the restaurant picks those they perceive as important diners and seats them at the corner, the chef will talk to them, and only them, the other non important patrons are seated in other tables, and very rarely do they get the attention (except if you plan to make a scene like the dairy screamer did). My companion wished that I had been the person who\\'s name was listed under the reservation: given my fancy job title at a fancy valley company and my elite yelper status, we might have been given a better seating assignment. Restaurants these days often google their diners to see who\\'s who. \\n\\nAs for food, there is no menu. Sashimi style seafood is superb. Wagu beef is very fatty, you either love or hate it. Lobster was amazing. Simply out of this world. Ingredients do shine in this restaurant. The quirkiness of the star chef is on display and it\\'s fine as well. But, the experience was ruined by the end of the night because of, sadly, the other patrons and the social pecking order. I will stick to my Benus and Saisons and Per Se\\'s, I shall not return nor recommend it to others.\\n',\n",
       " \"So much love for this place. Let's start with the music, soft 70s -90s rock. The stemware, plates and utensils are the highest of quality. The place is not pretentious at all and by no means stuffy however the fine details such as the stemware make the experience feel like pure luxury. Every course is placed on a silver platter until served. \\n\\nThe staff is AMAZING from the host to the sommelier to the line cooks... absolutely unreal. Let's talk about the chef... From the moment we sat down he asked how we were and thanked us for coming. He checked in on us at least 8 times throughout the night. I have been to so many Michelin restaurants, usually the chefs have no time of day of day for you. From 11 Madison Park to Per Se this chef is hands down the best, the most personable and gracious I've ever seen. \\n\\nNow onto the food. OMG. I can't even tell you.  If you appreciate seafood and want quality, this is the best tasting menu on the planet. About 3 of the courses were red meat based, the rest aside from 3 desert courses were seafood. In total we had about 18 courses. \\n\\nWe also did the 6 glass wine pairing which was also very good and matched perfectly. Glasses are poured at a fair amount. \\n\\nFor two people you're going to spend close to 1K but guess what, it's totally worth it. I would do it again tomorrow if I could. I've had all the top tasting menus in New York, this is hands down the best. Looking forward to their opening in Manhattan. \\n\\nSuch a great experience.\\n\",\n",
       " 'This does not deserve a Yelp 5 star. It is truly beyond that.\\n\\nMy experience was on January 2nd, 2013. I had high expectations for this meal and it delivered!\\n\\nYou get high quality, rare ingredients that is totally worth the price tag. Presentations are like works of art each course.\\n',\n",
       " \"This review is LONG over due:)  My bf and I had the pleasure of experiencing Chef's table at Brooklyn Fare in the summer of 2015.  It was one of the BEST dining experience of our lives, even hindsight.  The service was meticulous and every dish was amazing.  We still talk about it.  When we are back in NY, this will definitely be on our itinerary again (hopefully we can get a reservation).\\n\",\n",
       " \"Best meal I've ever had. Around 15 courses, mostly seafood. Super creative. Very fun watching them make everything. The wine pairing was spectacular. Service was flawless. The music was even great.\\n\\nI've walked by this place so many times as I shop at Brooklyn Fare and have always been jealous of the people eating inside. I now know I was right.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I got sick from the food I ate at this restaurant. I have been a chef for 20 years. I respect what they are trying to do and enjoyed the experience while I dined there, but when i called them to give them a heads up they basically told me to F off. I was not the only one in my party to get sick and the couple next to us got ill as well. (We had exchanged contact info for business and I had to ask). \\nWish they handled this situation better. Never going back. Would not recommend this restaurant.\\n',\n",
       " \"What else is there to say that others haven't? This might be the best meal I'll ever have in my life and the most expensive. But, if you love food, this is worth it. After most courses, I thought to myself, this is the most amazing thing I've ever tasted. Some of my favorites were the Hokkaido uni with black truffle, the foie gras with abalone, and the wagyu beef. There were a lot of firsts for me here. Never had real truffle, cavier, or had real 23k gold flakes on my food. Portions are just right. You will definitely leave here feeling full!\\n\\nI thought the service was great and very attentive. As others have said, the hostess doesn't really explain what they're serving you but she had to do it about 5 times in a row, so I understand. If you ask her for further explanation, she did.\\n\\nWe had about 15 courses on the night we went and each had the 4 wine pairing. As a fellow yelper said, you're already paying so much for this meal, why not go all out and add the wine pairing? I'm glad we did but if you're a weak drinker like me, after the midway point, you start getting a little sleepy from the wine and from being full. Also, having reservations at 10pm didn't help either. We didn't finish our meal until close to 1AM!\\n\",\n",
       " \"I admit I held off going here for a while but was swayed by the recent Eater review. A couple months back I went to Momofuku Ko and declared it the best restaurant in New York (for whatever it's worth). Now that I've been to Chef's Table, though, I think it might be too close to call.\\n\\nThis food at Chef's Table is different from most high-end New York restaurants, which tend to be very French-influenced and assault you with super rich flavors. The obvious influence here is Japanese food, and much of the food reminds me a lot of what I've experienced at upscale kaiseki restaurants in Tokyo. The flavors are subtle and the preparations are minimal. Chef Ramirez is, like great chefs in the Japanese tradition, a master of composing and balancing dishes that emphasize the inherent quality of their ingredients, rather than engaging in technical wizardry (though he no doubt could if he wanted to). \\n\\nAlso, as with a great Japanese meal, there's a lot of fish here. Of the dozen or so savory dishes I tasted, all but three were seafood. The exceptions were a gorgeously composed pickled vegetable and edible flower medley, a perfectly cooked cut of roast duck, and a thin slice of A5 Miyazaki wagyu ribeye that transcended mere mortal conceptions of just how good red meat can be. I think the highlight was the Japanese sea bass with shiso butter, whose skin was scalded with wood coals.\\n\\nThe service was phenomenal, though personally I found the wait staff to be a little too stiff and formal for a restaurant whose atmosphere was otherwise warm and inviting. Ramirez himself, though, was a pleasure to speak to as we did several times throughout the meal. \\n\\nThe wine pairing featured several great French wines, but it wasn't quite as interesting as some other restaurants whose pairings dig deeper into world wines and other spirits (for a place with such Japanese influence in the food, you'd expect there to at least be sake).\\n\\nSo, to conclude, I think Chef's Table has the best food in the city. The other aspects of the experience--service, alcohol, atmosphere--are good but not as remarkable. It will be interesting to see how things evolve when they move into their new Manhattan space later this year.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I was so excited when I was able to score a reservation at the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.  I've heard that it is one of the most difficult restaurants to get into (such as Per Se), so I literally almost had an accident in my pants when I got through on their reservation line!  Brooklyn Fare is a grocery store that has been around the Brooklyn neighborhood for ages; the owner of the store, Moe Issa, wanted to add a restaurant, and found Chef Cesar Ramirez to partner up with to open up a restaurant that features the fresh produce (the Chef's Table is not IN the grocery store, but located a few doors down).  The restaurant is an intimate 18-seat space where the menu is never known until the day of to finalize, and it is up to Chef Ramirez and his team to plate over twenty small plate courses for you to enjoy.  It is predominately shell-fish oriented and Japanese-influenced.  I was star struck when I saw Chef Ramirez, literally right there in person, all hands-on with the plating, the clearing, and even presenting the plates.  You can tell that he has very high expectations, very attentive to details, extremely focused, and very passionate about food.  He is reserved, but he is definitely cool if you get a chance to chit-chat with him (my husband was able to engage in a conversation while I went to the restroom - darn my weak bladder!!!).  You aren't allowed to take pictures or take notes, and there is no copy of the menu, so that was a little upsetting for me (since I am so OCD with taking pictures of all my food), but it really gave me the opportunity to enjoy each dish without focusing on snapping away.  I loved watching the Chef and his team plate each dish meticulously, and being presented with a little info from the lone server in the center (she stated that she has to jump in and out!).  I remember each dish being extremely delicious, perfectly seasoned, beautifully presented, and a great portion size so that you leave happily content - the amount being served lets you enjoy each of the ingredients while not being too under- or overwhelmed.  Out of respect for the Chef and the restaurant, I will not list all the dishes I memorized, but some of my favorites/highlights included: the sea urchin/uni porridge, the caviar, the shiso sorbet, the melting ball of chocolate with the butterscotch ice cream, and the little tray of mini desserts with 23K gold flakes (yum yum YUM!).  It was definitely a great experience, and I loved that we were able to try this place out to celebrate our anniversary! :D  I also like the fact that you don't have to whip out your card to pay at the end, as what you used for your reservation is automatically charged for the party, the service charge, as well as the gratuity - I really thought that that was quite convenient!  So instead of a bill, you get a nice handwritten message, thanking you :D  The group of friendly sweet folks who sat to the left of us were so much fun with a great sense of humor - it was a great evening, and I would love to come back again and try out their ever-changing menu!  :D\\n\\n+Chef Ramirez in the FLESH!\\n+no photos allowed\\n\",\n",

Very professional...just the right amount of everything, even portions. We are big fans of tasting things. Not going crazy. Brooklyn Fare is great for this.\\n\",\n",

This did not stop me from sneaking a few pictures.\\nThe courses, as best I can remember (I am sure I forgot a few, and they are out of order):\\n- Started with trout roe on a cracker. Very good.\\n- Uni with black truffle. My first time having uni. Tastes like a sponge filled with chlorine. Not to my taste but my dining companions liked it. \\n- Osetra caviar with sturgeon foam. OBSCENE!!! So delicious. And I felt like a big baller eating it.\\n- Lobster with butter. Also delicious.\\n- Some kind of fish with risotto. Fell super flat.\\n- Foie gras in a soup. Also fell flat.\\n- Pickled vegetables in a miso sauce. Wonderful flavors and textures.\\n- Wagyu beef with a heart of palm and a bit of radish. The wagyu was delicious of course, but I\\'ve had better wagyu before.\\n- Duck breast with huckleberries. Loved it. So tender and fatty with a crispy skin.\\n- Some kind of ice cream...I forget what. But it tasted like a green juice (kale, lemon, celery, apple, ginger) in ice cream form. I loved it.\\n- Passion fruit ice cream. WOW! This is what god\\'s p***y tastes like. So sweet and tangy and creamy. \\n- Frozen chocolate souffle. Also wonderful. Delicate airy texture. Milk chocolate flavor, with a yogurt-like tang and some vanilla too.\\n- Mini financier and chocolate hazelnut truffles. Delicious too.\\n\\nThe pacing of the meal was not ideal. There was a 30 minute gap between the fish and meat courses. \\n\\nThe layout of the restaurant is such that everyone is seated around a table. Who you are seated next to can VASTLY INFLUENCE your dining experience. The dude sitting next to me was incredibly obnoxious. He made dumb comments to the man serving and presenting the food, telling him that he had \"no job security\". He was super loud and would not shut up. Someone kept peeing on the toilet seat in the bathroom. I bet it was him.\\n\\nThe highlights were the Osetra caviar, duck breast, and the desserts. Good? Yes. Overrated? Yes.\\n',\n",

An extremely expensive experience!  The waitress kept trying to take my food before i finished each course! So extremely rude, she could see i had food on my plate every time.  The plates are tiny and only have 1-3 bites, so if there is food on your plate, basically costing around $30 a plate for 1-3 bites, please waitress and chef, LET US FINISH OUR BITES!! Way too rushed between courses.  Not relaxing and no time to enjoy and talk  about what you are eating let alone converse with your dining partner before they try and whisk away your plate and quickly present another.  The food was beautiful, elegant, delectable and succulent.  But memorable? Not sure as i had not enough time to even take in the memory before another swiped that moment away.  The Servers seem well instructed to keep the pace fast, and they seem not relaxed.  Hard to digest properly all around in this kind of atmosphere.\\nI would SLOW IT DOWN for the price you pay this food needs to be savored\\n',\n",
       " \"Came here earlier in the year and had a fantastic meal. Hard to imagine that Chef's Table originally started off as more Japanese, as today I would have given it Japanese-inspired at most. I sat at one of the middle tables with friends, not at the counter. We enjoyed trout roe tart, a really great Japanese mackerel and radish, an excellent sea perch with white miso, Norwegian king crab with apple and shiso, the ever-famous uni with black truffle course--absolutely amazing, ossetra caviar, koshihikari rice with black truffle--a very interesting dish, miyazaki beef, and grapefruit sorbet with finger lime. While I hear that the Manhattan location is not as good as the old Brooklyn location, the space in Midtown West is much better. Some may find it disorienting to walk through a grocery store to get to the 3-Michelin star restaurant but I think it keeps the New York charm. Of course, service is top-notch and presentation was fantastic. Highly recommend if you're willing to splurge.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Quite an amazing experience. Each course is carefully designed and exquisitely executed. \\nPersonally I think the master piece we had is the vegetable dish (mind you that this comes from a meat-lover) - each vegetable retains its own unique delicious fresh taste and harmoniously interacts with others \\n\\nNow, as a big wine head, I think the wine paring (I did a 4 glass tasting) is also very decent - it was quite generous pours, and they keep pouring even after you finish.\\n\\n1) It starts with a Chablis (to go with fish and shell fish starters). The slightly oaky Chablis does its job, nothing complicated, but decent. \\n2) Chateau Simone, Palette AC, Provence. It's a somewhat heavy white wine. Clairette/Grenache Blanc grapes. This is a wonderful paring with the dishes (Mushroom broth chawanmushi, etc)\\n3) a Chateauneuf du Pape, nicely fitted with the meat dishes\\n4) Tokaj, amazing way to finish a meal with dessert. \\n\\n\\nThe only downside comes with sitting in essentially a kitchen to dine is that you get smoky/oily smell on your hair and jacket - This does not bother us that much. \\n\\nWould come back again for sure.\\n\",\n",
       " 'As far as 3-Michelin star experiences go, CT is something special, and very unique. Walking into the grocery store and making your way to the back does not prepare you for the wonderful experience awaiting behind the sliding doors leading into the restaurant.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, the staff far exceeded my expectations for the evening. At this level of restaurant you expect perfection in service - but to have the staff so clearly be in sync and be laughing with you, conversing (and sharing details about you to assist one another with conversation), and making you feel so comfortable was a high mark for BK Fare. \\n\\nI enjoyed the informal wine pairings as opposed to specific wines for each course. Having the staff choose wines for a number of the courses felt more natural to me and I definitely enjoyed not ever feeling rushed in that way.\\n\\nOf course, the food is something very special here - that is no secret. The uni with black truffle is sublime, caviar dish about halfway through was absolutely a favorite, and rounding out my top three would be the almond frozen souffle. Of course, every course was expertly done and wonderful, those 3 in particular though stole the show, for me at least.\\n\\nAfterwards, even sitting at the counter where time is more closely monitored than at the tables, we never felt rushed. We had some espresso and sake, chatted with staff and among ourselves for a bit and finally (reluctantly) left.

There\\'s a waiter in the table center who makes sure no water glass is ever empty. No photos allowed during the meal to keep it civilized and jacket is required despite a relaxed atmosphere. There are 13 items, all small , and the staff is knowledgeable about every detail of preparation and ingredient. \\nThe first dish was a trout roe over creme fraiche and dill, great stuff. Then a uni on toast with black truffle (im not convinced black truffle has any flavor), also very good, almost practically on par with Soto. Then a mackerel which was nice as it wasn\\'t too fishy, I saw it cooked with a hot coal. I\\'m now interested in what elite sushi chefs do compared to average counterparts. There was a miso fish, which is always a good item (shout out to Bond Street miso Chilean sea bass) There was a small poached lobster based dish which is a hit for those liking lobster. There was also a warm rice/cheese item (not my thing), an A5 wagyu beef (highest grade) - if you\\'ve not had this it\\'s like prime rib that melts in your mouth - but give me a meaty bone in ribeye any day. There was a fish with a salty soup stock base and a mushroom I hadn\\'t heard of, the salty stock turned me off. There was a caviar cream dish which was an oysters and pearls style dish...but although I don\\'t even think Per Se\\'s oysters and pearls was so special ..per se used higher quality caviar. The dessert was three items: a citrus sorbet with a scoop of lime finger seeds. This was certainly a reflection to the caviar dish. Next was an amazingly created chocolate frozen \"soufflé\" that I\\'m still perplexed how it\\'s created; something with liquid nitrogen and dip-and-dots I\\'m sure. It looked like a solid cake and they give you a chilled spoon but it melts once you touch it. There\\'s some nice small vanilla dessert pieces to follow. \\nBrooklyn Fare is about the chefs table experience. You are very near the busy kitchen and can watch and should ask the waiters questions about what the chef is doing, that\\'s the point. It\\'s very pricey but like Eleven Madison Park, you\\'re paying for an event. Also, it\\'s near the a/c subway stop so it\\'s easy to get to, despite the brooklyn address.\\n',\n",
       " 'Very different fine dining experience. Reservations seem to be made in blocks, such that everyone will be served the same items at the same time.

Although there\\'s unfortunately no wine pairing option, we just asked the waitress to keep the wine coming, of various types. Reservations are crazy hard to get! Check their website for details. It took me 72 phone calls over 1.5hrs. Out of all the fine dining I\\'ve done in NYC, this only get 4 stars because (1) not all the dishes blew my mind and (2) I wasn\\'t full at the end.

It\\'s a little repetitious even if the preparation was slightly different.  Also, most of the opening courses were slices of different very fresh sashimi that had different infused oil and garnished slightly differently. Nothing new that I haven\\'t seen done in other places. Not worthy of a 3 Michelin Star restaurant.  \\n\\nWe were also disappointed by the service.  This is a chef\\'s table, so you assume that there will be some interaction between you and the people preparing the food.  There was absolutely no interaction.  Why call it a chef\\'s table if the chef never came by to talk to the guests and explain his dishes and preparation? The chef was very preoccupied with one \"special\" guest and absolutely ignored the rest of us.  Aren\\'t we special too?

We arrived with a 15 minute buffer so had plenty of time to sit, peruse the wine list and take it all in.

T and I have had a number of tasting menus before at other NYC spots but this one takes the cake.  Each dish seemed almost better than the last with the flavors slowly building up in intensity.  The flavor combinations were fresh and kept my palate interested - it's hard to remember every detail but there were hints of Asian influence in several of the dishes with a strong presence of seafood in all of our savory courses (just the last savory course was non-seafood, a perfect couple of pieces of squab).  My definite favorite was the uber-decadent uni and truffle dish.  Amazing.  It makes my mouth water just thinking about it.\\n\\nThe dishes do come at a pretty fast pace but it's amazing to sit, slowly chewing and tasting each course, while watching the chef and his staff carefully construct each dish.\\n\\nWe also had an amazing cheese course (paired with nuts, honey and preserves, it was mind blowingly good) a sorbet course, a pastry course and chocolates at the end.  These were all paired with a lovely sweet wine.\\n\\nService was impeccable, our sommelier was friendly and the chef even chatted a bit with our side of the table in between courses, which was a nice extra touch.\\n\\nWhile it is terribly difficult to get a reservation and it's very formal and it's VERY expensive, I would recommend Chef's Table to any foodie and hope to come here again for another special occasion.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Celebrating my birthday with my special someone at Chef's Table was truly an amazing experience, especially since I have a love for food.  \\n\\nThe reservations are truly hard to come by, they take them 6 weeks in advance and the phone line is literally busy for hours.  Very lucky that my boyfriend knew how much I've wanted to try Chef's Table and was able to get a reservation on my actual birthday!\\n\\nIt is a very intimate setting when you're sitting at the chefs table with only 18 seats and a clear view of the kitchen.  The entire experience was very enjoyable as you can see one  sous chef torching the fish while another was preparing another integral part.  As mentioned by other yelpers, this is a seafood based meal with only one meat dish at the very end.\\n\\nI was impressed with every single dish and all the intricate details and pairings of flavor and texture.  Chef Ramirez uses the best source quality for each dish where as these fine pairings would be additional add ons at Per Se.  Each of the 20+ dishes were executed beautifully in unison between Chef Ramirez and his two sous chefs. The service was on point throughout our whole meal even though it was the late 10pm seating. The server was very helpful and friendly and made conversations with all the guests.\\n\\nThe three dishes that stood out to me most during my magical experience was the Hokkaido Uni & black truffle, Squid, and the akamatsu in red rice vinegar. \\n\\nI must mention, even at Per se and other reputable restaurants in NYC the fresh uni they provide is from Santa Barbara, CA, but Chef Ramirez provides something even better, fresh uni from Hokkaido, Japan.  I was skeptical at first since keeping uni fresh from Japan you must go through great lengths but I was in love after my first bite.  The uni was fresh and topped with black truffle.  Before I took a bite the aroma of the black truffle was resounding in front of me.  \\n\\nThe next dish that deserves to be mentioned in the dish that contained lobster & squid.  But the main star was the line caught squid from Japan that is only in season two months of the year.  This squid was unlike any squid I had every tried, it was very chewy and grilled perfectly.  \\n\\nThis was the first time I tried akamatsu, and I'm wondering why I've been missing out.  The fish's skin was torched and was delicious while the red rice vinegar adds for a delectable sauce. \\n\\nI will definitely be back again. This goes down in my Top 3 list alongside Per se with add ons and Joel Robuchon's full tasting menu (Las Vegas MGM).\\n\",\n",

After spending 45 minutes to make a reservation 6 weeks in advance of my husband's birthday, we show up to the restaurant to be informed that they gave my reservation away. They claimed they would have contacted me several times by email and phone two weeks prior to confirm. I had no record of any phone or email communication from them. They are still investigating and apologized offering to permit me to skip the wait on hold the next time I made a reservation. \\n\\nI don't care how amazing your food is. If you want to charge $350 per person in Brooklyn and have the most complex and difficult reservation system in the tri-state area you cannot pull something like  this. Beyond unacceptable.\\n\",\n",

Every dish was delicious, although with every tasting we would get too full by middle of the meal. Yet, I would say it's worth the experience. Only thing I didn't like was, of course, not being able to take photos of the courses but I do understand that they are trying to keep the ambiance and respect to the other customers. I'm a visual person and like to look back and remember what I ate. Although I'm glad they did allow us to take photos of ourselves towards the end of the evening. Kinda sad we didn't get a photo with the chef before he left. Anyhow, definitely recommend this tasting. Loved it!\\n\",\n",

And, further to some other Yelper's comments on here, I'm pretty sure I experienced the Chef's temper first-hand when I was served a slightly over - cooked piece of Waygu.  Served this, IMHO, because I was the last one seated - not late, mind you - but the last to sit. This was during the earlier seating, so it didn't interfere with the flow of the night overall, but it seemingly mattered to him. Overall, I appreciate the creativity, skill and quality of ingredients on display here, but not the ego.  In short, I wouldn't go as far as calling this man a racist, but I will loudly proclaim him a bit of a douche. For that, one star off.\\n\\nAnother star removed for the unimaginative wine pairings.  Yes, the wines were delicious, but I want to be blown away.  At Blanca, some of the pairings involved stout - and - wait for it - sweet vermouth.  They were outstanding and completely unexpected.  You feel as though Blanca is having fun and enjoying the experience they bring to the patrons.  And when you're spending around  $500 pp for dinner, don't you want to enjoy yourself completely -not feel like you're at church waiting for communion?\\n\",\n",

Yelp removed my original review... I can\\'t believe it. Here\\'s my review again of my OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE at this restaurant. About how I was treated like crap for pointing out that I had sand in my langoustine and had my dish thrown out without getting it replaced (Umm, hello, we\\'re paying $1000 for this meal...) and then having Chef Cesar Ramirez treat me poorly the rest of the night.\\n\\nHere\\'s my review with a few things removed....\\n\\nShort story: I found a mouthful of sand in my langoustine. When I told Chef about it, he took my plate away and said he\\'d \"take care of it\". In any other Michelin Star establishment, this usually means they\\'ll replace my seafood with fresh seafood that doesn\\'t have sand in it. Or maybe that means they\\'ll comp me with SOMETHING, a different dish to eat, maybe a glass of wine, WHATEVER. But basically he took my entire course away and didn\\'t give me anything but a half-hearted apology, went to the back to yell at his 3 sous chefs, and then made me feel like crap the rest of the night as he happily chatted with all the rest of the guests the rest of the night but avoided us like the plague. \\n\\nCan you imagine this happening at ANY OTHER fine establishments. If I had found sand in my langoustine in Marea, Le Bernardin, Per Se, do you think they would have made me feel like I did something wrong?\\n\\nAs I sit on the thought, we paid nearly $1000 for this meal ($255 for tasting, $150 for wine tasting + MANDATORY 20% tip). \\n\\nJust keep this all in mind as you debate if you should hand him a boatload of money just so you can have a good meal. Yes, the food was amazing, one of the best in my life, but the service left a really sour taste in my mouth. Don\\'t make the active decision to dine here. There\\'s plenty of restaurants out here in NYC MUCH more deserving of your time and money.\\n',\n",
       " \"Let me write a longer review that shows I've been here so yelp doesn't delete my review. I was extremely excited to eat here in my short stay in nyc since my friend raved about this place being his favorite.   When you're only in nyc for 4 days and there are several 3 star michelin restaurants to choose from, you expect to have the best experience for the amount of money you pay.  We were able to dine at two 3 star michelin restaurants during our short stay. \\n\\nLe bernardin at first and let's stay they are impeccable with their dishes.  From the service to describing the dishes, they know how to treat a guest.  We even went as far as asking for a kitchen tour which they happily obliged.  Unfortunately, chef Ripert had already left the building. \\n\\nFast forward to chefs table.  I've heard this is an intimate setting and for dropping hundreds on a meal, you would expect the experience to be intimate.  Ours was anything but that.  Maybes he's not racist but he sure isn't the same with everyone.  He was at the door to greet guests yet he refused to take a picture. He chatted it up with the guests on the sides and sat us dead center.  The ingredients of each plate are only briefly described and  didn't feel sincere.  Some dishes are good but nothing memorable where we wanted to say damn!  You'll definitely be left hungry.  My fiance was already thinking about pizza before we even left.  \\n\\nI'm sure every palate is different as is every experience but in my experience all 3 star michelin restaurants should be held to higher standards and I didn't leave satisfied.

Yeah he has about $80,000 worth of Mauviel copper pots hanging above the kitchen and a $180,000 Molteni stove but that\\'s about the most impressive part of the decor. Second, allegations of the racism is PROBABLY true. I don\\'t remember him speaking to our party of 4 (Asians) except to tell us no photos. We were not seated in the center close to him.

       " \"I was holding off on writing this review at a later time but I figured with all this controversy going on, now would be as good of a time as any other.  To preface I want to say that unlike most of the recent reviews on this page,  I ACTUALLY had a meal here recently and I am of Asian decent (though thankfully not an Upper West Sider =P).\\n\\nWith all that being said, I can wholeheartedly say that though I am far from a top class diner,  I am fairly experienced and have had my fair share of great meals and by far Chef's Table is the best meal and service I have ever had. Every staff member from top to bottom was very nice, gracious and helpful. Chef Ramirez has a reputation for being shy, cold and an asshole but the conversations I had with him were pleasant and felt genuine. The lovely, blonde lady that was the main server whose post was inside the horseshoe table was absolutely marvelous. I wish I remembered her name so that I can thank her again properly. Watching her work was almost as impressive as the meal itself. She presented each dish minimally but could answer any questions in great detail if asked. She glided from guest to guest remembering the type of water you preferred, which hand is your dominant and many other small details that even further enhanced the dining experience.\\n\\nAs for the meal, it really was an amazing experience. 18+ courses that progressed from properly light to heavy combining Japanese and French flavor and ingredients. I felt embarrassed for all the eye rolls and and head turns from culinary glee. Chef's ability to take exceptional ingredients and lightly coax and enhance them to show their true flavors was apparent from start to finish. The meal was indeed a special event and well worth the time, money and effort. The wine pairing is a must and there are two options, four pairings or six. Before our meal had even ended my dining companion and I were already dreaming of our next visit.\\n\\n*** As far as the lawsuit and hoopla goes, I do not know chef personally and won't defend him. What I do know is that when I was a patron I did not feel mistreated nor noticed any prejudice or biased in the least bit. My dining companion and I paid attention throughout the night and marveled at the level of skill, detail and service and not once did we see him treat us any differently then any of the other diners. I was even complimented on my knowledge of the ingredients and cooking techniques that the staff was practicing while I was discussing the topics during the meal. Chef came over to check on us multiple times and we had a fairly lengthy and pleasant conversation at the completion of the meal.  In fact, upon writing this review and discussions with friends I have been informed by other Asians that they too are confused by these allegations after their positive dining experience here. Maybe the allegations are true, maybe they are not. Maybe he had a bad day or was misunderstood, maybe the staff is trying to get revenge or proper compensation. We don't know and hopefully we will find out. But those of you trying to shame him and his restaurant without ever stepping a foot inside should be ashamed of yourself, especially those of you that are Elite members.  Who are you to pass such quick judgement based on accusations without knowing all the facts?  I could possibly eat my words if the real truth comes out and things are truly as bad as they are said to be, but it still doesn't change my dining experience and isn't that what this site is about?\\n\",\n",

I took my bf to Brooklyn Fare this past weekend for his birthday and his quote was \"this was the best meal that I\\'ve had in the US.\" Coming from a guy who has ate at the likes of French Laundry, Joel Robouchon, and Benu, I was very pleased and patted myself on the back that I was able to find a place that thoroughly impressed him.\\n\\nI have to say that this meal was SO spot on. Each dish was perfectly executed, the flavors were unique and blended together so well, and the staff was amazing! After reading reviews, I was slightly concerned, but Chef Ramirez was SO kind and talked to us throughout dinner. We asked about his menu since it is very, very Japanese influenced and he said it\\'s because he worked in Japan for 8 years. \\n\\nSometimes you go to fine dining restaurants where the presentation is great, but the food isn\\'t spectacular. Well, we had 18 courses and each dish blew my mind away... from the caviar and egg custard, to the many sashimi dishes, to the amazing risotto with uni and abalone (the girl next to us literally used her finger at the end to eat up all of the remaining sauce - I was kind of grossed out but could relate bc I wanted to lick my plate), duck with an apple mash and stuffed mushroom, and to the shiso sorbet (which I could have ate a pint of by myself)... I honestly could say that after every dish we looked at each other saying wow, that was just amazing, what are these flavors, how did he make this, can we have seconds?? You can tell he uses only the best ingredients.\\n\\nI had heard about what was written about Chef Ramirez and had the opposite experience. We were sat closest to him (my bf and I are Asian), he talked to us throughout dinner, he was very gracious to us at the end of dinner and thanked us for coming, took a picture with us, and seemed super kind to his staff. He also walked around and talked to everyone when the meal was over and took pictures when requested regardless of who the diners were. Maybe he is over compensating for everything that was written about him, but I honestly didn\\'t get that vibe from him at all. The space is so small you literally can hear them talking the whole time and you can see exactly what they are doing... so the whole rumor about giving Asians the worst pieces of meat - I\\'m not sure how that would happen?\\n\\nEITHER WAY I don\\'t care - I would recommend this experience to anyone! The 3 Michelin stars are so well deserved. I left feeling satisfied, but not disgusting like how you\\'d normally feel after 18 courses.

However, fast forward to one year later. I finally got the opportunity to eat here again and I am so amazed with my experience. Last night was one of the most memorable dining experiences I have ever had. When we arrived we were seated around the bar top table and were sent on a ride of a lifetime. We were told no pictures are allowed so I was forced to memorize all 15 courses in my head. The Chef conducted his service like a maestro conducting an orchestra. It was so smooth and seamless but what impressed me the most was how quite they were. It was almost as if they were reading each others minds. The symphony of food started with a red trout caviar tartlet which we paired perfectly with a nice glass of champagne. This one bite first course was sensational and it wet our appetite for the rest of the meal. Our 2nd course was Uni with a slice of black truffle. It was crazy good! Our 3rd course was a sabayon with potato and black caviar. It was excellent. Our 4th, 5th and 6th course were Langoustines prepared 3 ways, cold, warm and hot. They imported them from an island next to Norway. They were so sweet and succulent. Our 7th course was a sea bream in a basil sauce. Our 8th course was one of my favorites. It was a beautiful arrangement of seasonal vegetables and edible leaves. Each vegetable had a different preparation and flavor profile. It made me realize how great vegetables can be considering I'm a big meat lover. Our 9th course was another favorite it was a duck breast that was smoked and seared. It was not too Gamey and cooked perfectly! Our 10th course was another stand out. It was Wagyu Beef imported from Japan. It was so tender and buttery that it just melted in my mouth. The 11th course was a Huckleberry Sorbet with fresh huckleberries. It was a great palate cleanser. Courses 12-15 were all different types of desserts and hand made chocolates.  Once again they were all amazing. I know this place is very pricey but the quality of what you get is worth every dollar. At the end of the meal we even had a chance to take a picture with the head chef by his kitchen work space.\\n\",\n",

And not one but TWO desserts! Despite all the courses I walked away feeling comfortably but not I-think-I\\'m-going-to-explode-full as I have at other establishments with lengthy tasting menus. \\n\\nYes the price tag is hefty, especially if you choose to get one of the 4 or 6 glass wine pairings with the meal. But Chef Ramirez incorporates so many generous servings of \"luxury\" ingredients into his cooking that the price tag feels (slightly) justified. \\n\\nAnd for what it\\'s worth, I did not once feel discriminated during my meal here.

       " \"For my 1700th review, I would like to share my experience at Brooklyn's only 3 Michlein starred restaurant, the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.\\n\\nMichelin are a very traditional organisation and they usually make restaurants 'do their time' at 1 star and 2 stars before promotion to the next level.\\n\\nI remember reading excitedly and sadly (because it was so far away) in the UK travel section about this intimate eatery opening surprisingly in Brooklyn and have followed its meteoric rise to being the holder of 3 Michelin stars in only 3 years\\n\\nSeating only 18 guests, I had low hopes of getting a reservation on my recent trip to New York as I was only in town for one day. However, on corresponding with the restaurant about their reservation process, I was able to secure my reservation for the night I was in New York\\n\\nThey do have a clear but specific way of doing things. A credit card secures your reservation and about a week before your visit, they will charge your card for the full amount for dinner (currently $225), tax and gratuity, leaving you to only pay for drinks on the night. They only serve one tasting menu which is decided at the last minute based on the best produce available. The menu is heavy on seafood and diners are warned about this beforehand and it is pointed out that the menu isn't suitable for vegetarians\\n\\nI met my New York fine dining friend Dana F who was joining for dinner at Brooklyn Fare deli to have a look round and get our appetite going. There was amazing produce here and I thought one only had to walk round to get inspiration for an amazing meal. However, the ingredients for our meal was actually completely diffeent and a lot of it was imported directly from places like Japan just for the restaurant\\n\\nThe Chef's Table is located a few doors down from the deli. You do feel like you've stepped into someone's (admittedly very posh) kitchen with the 18 seats surrounding on 3 sides a central station manned (or on our night, womanned) by a server and the chefs led by Cesar Ramirez doing their magic in the kitchen area on the 4th side. I love the fact that you can see the chefs creating your food though there's little interaction with them except when Chef Ramirez comes round for a little chat\\n\\nGuests are served in 2 groups with the start of the meal for the 2 groups staggered. Service is top notch Michelin standard with seamless coordination between the kithcen, the central server and the other servers round the outside managing drinks etc. If anything, it was a little serious though I did get Bryn, our central server to smile and have a laugh with us by the end of the evening\\n\\nMy only gripe for the evening was that non drinkers weren't catered for at all. The only drink on offer was water though Bryn did a grand job at making sure my water glass was topped up the whole time. The attention to detail extends to things like having chilled spoons for cold dishes\\n\\nBrooklyn Fare is also famous for one thing which is pointed out to diners in the e-mail that arrives with your booking - a strict no photos and no note taking policy. Watching Chef Ramirez when he is plating up dishes, I can understand why. The look he gives his food is like a parent gazing upon a child - the pride is evident. I think he just wants you to be savouring the food he creates, concentrating fully on the flavours, textures and temperatures\\n\\nHowever, as a Yelper, it was so painfully frustrating for Dana and I to watch the more exquisitely beautiful creations pass before us without being able to get a visual or textual record of what we were eating. Let me assure you that the presentation of the dishes is amazing\\n\\nStarting with the most tomatoey tomato consomme and cucumber foam, we were then treated to 20 plus dishes of exquisite Japanese inspired food. Chef Ramirez later told us that a trip to Japan changed his whole persepctive to food and he pays homage in his cooking\\n\\nThe meal begins with a whole cold starter section of different fish flown in from Japan enhanced by various condiments and accompaniments. The amount of work which goes into producing so many elements for all those dishes is mind-boggling. My favourite was Japanese crab brought to life with a zing of lime\\n\\nIn the hot section, there was an amazing duck, which had perfect crispy skin, fat rendered to almost nothing and moist succulent meat. That was probably my dish of the night but with over to enjoy, you will find much to savour and remember about your meal here\\n\\nBeing professional celebrity chef stalkers, Dana and I appreciated Chef Ramirez coming out for a chat. Talking to him, you can sense his passion for cooking and his commitment to keep his operation small in order to maintain his high standards. Happily, we were allowed an embargo on the no photos rule t get our picture taken with Chef Ramirez\\n\\nA unique dining experience. Yes, there is great Michelin starred food to be found in Brooklyn!\\n\",\n",

You are not allowed to take pics, which makes it hard for me to remember everything we had.  The menu changes frequently.  Our recent visits were this January and April, the menu was very different.  A few things I remember are: Caviar dish that was amazing. Sea Urchin with truffle - no words, just pure bliss!.Foie Gras in broth was divine! Grilled veggies - was good but not amazing (everything can't be a 10, so this was an 8). Lobster dish and fish dish, which were both great. Frozen chocolate soufflé - creative and delicious. Everything is really fresh and creatively prepared.\\nWine list is what you would expect from a three star Michelin restaurant.  Christine is there to help you narrow down your selection. She has an amazing memory!!  She actually remembered the wine we had in January when we dined at the restaurant in April.  She is super personable and makes the dining experience that much more enjoyable.  \\n\\nAtmosphere/Service:  I really love the intimate seating and proximity to the kitchen.  There are 16-18 seats around a massive stainless counter.  Everything is super shining.  The service is very attentive.  You are seated really close to the other diners, so it's nice to have people that are semi-friendly during the dinner.  \\n\\nThis is really one of my favorite fine dining experiences.  I can't wait until they move to the city. Hopefully, adopt a way to make a reservation that's less time consuming.\\n\",\n",

       " 'First of all, stop rating the restaurant based on the racism allegation; let the court be the judge and, most importantly, let Chef Cesar Ramirez\\'s food be the voice on Yelp.  Be aware - it\\'s a chef\\'s table style....so don\\'t expect table cloth, chandelier, etc.  Enjoy the action in the kitchen.  I could not leave my eyes off and I thought one of the handsome chefs was hitting on me.  Wow.....seriously - \"a racist\" restaurant hitting a gay Asian?  Come on.....people.  Let the food be the judge.  Oh....Chef Cesar Ramirez actually had time to go around and greeted his customers individually.  He did not single us out nor gave us extra attention.\\n\\n\\nSecondly, I am NOT going to mention how much of my bill for 4 people just for wine.  We opened two bottles of champagne and 1 bottle of Burgundy - I have to say.....the prices on the wine list were a bargain if you\\'re truly into food and wine.  David, the sommelier, surprised us (even me) with the Burgundy.\\n\\nNow.....for the food: Japanese-inspired 15-course dinner  brilliantly brought out the freshness of fish and Waygu beef.  While many of the reviewers liked the one-bite sea urchin with black truffle.  It was actually the ONLY dish that I felt lukewarm.  I loved both black truffle and sea urchin.  However, the aroma and taste of black truffle overpowered the sea urchin (in my opinion).  I also liked the apple smoke infused caviar with potatoes in this winter weather.  While I saw the preparation of green ice-cream, I thought it would be green-tea sorbet......NO NO NO - it was yuzu sorbet!  What a great idea having that yuzu taste stay in the palate toward the end of the meal.  \\n\\nWhat I did not enjoy:\\n- I had no idea what I would be eating.  Thus, ordering wine was difficult for me.  Sommelier first gave me lecture about the upcoming fish dishes and my mind was like.....\"really - you are telling me what to drink?  Go to Twitter and find me first....\" However, he was helpful to guide customers.  \\n- I wished the chef would have the menu (what we ate) when we left the restaurant.....a little memory.\\n- I did not understand the reservation system even though I did not make tonight reservation 6 weeks ahead.  I heard that customers needed to call Monday only for reservation.\\n\\nTonight was our first time to this restaurant.  YES - I am Asian; my spouse is Brazilian; we married last month at the NY Carnegie Hall (first wedding at the Carnegie Hall).  So....Asian, Brazilian, and gay......yet we did not feel any discrimination.  We look forward to returning to this restaurant for consistency and outstanding meal.\\n',\n",

       " 'I surprised my boyfriend with dinner here last night for his birthday. Overall, it was an incredible experience, however there were a few faux-pas that should have not happened considering the three Michelin stars.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with the good:\\n\\n- The food is phenomenal. I\\'ve been to Jean Georges, Per Se, Eleven Madison Park, Blanca, Martin Berasategui, and Astrance. I\\'d comfortably say the food is exactly on par with Blanca (Blanca is like the Italian version of Chef\\'s Table), and Martin Berasategui is maybe just a hair better (yes, I know I\\'m comparing apples and oranges). The uni with black truffle is the best course, followed by the langoustine, then the roe, then the fluke and the wagyu. The squab was not good (more on that later).\\n\\n- The wine pairing was phenomenal. Per our request, our Captain emailed us a list of all the wines in the pairing (so we can hopefully stock our cabinet with some of the more reasonably priced ones!)\\n\\n- I made sure our reservation was for the countertop as opposed to a dark booth in the back corner. I\\'m not sure why someone would want an isolated, dark table all the way along the wall when you can instead watch the action happening before your eyes. That is one of the best parts.\\n\\n- Chef Ramirez was totally down to earth and friendly. He made genuine conversation (not canned, phony small talk), with my boyfriend and me for nearly five minutes at the start of dinner which made us feel great.\\n\\n- our sommelier (forgot her name, but she is incredibly polite, knowledgable, and smiley) was AMAZING. She should honestly teach a training to the rest of the staff on social grace and people skills because that was seriously lacking amongst other key players of the team.\\n\\nNow, the not-so-good:\\n\\n- Making a reservation here is a real pain in the tush. I didn\\'t have any connections I could work, so I had to call Monday at 10:30am six weeks in advance, and I must have dialed 75 times in a row before giving up. I tried calling again at around 12:45pm that same day and finally got through to someone. I was in disbelief when I got a table. Moral of the story is, don\\'t give up, and try calling back at random times during the day.\\n\\n- I told the initial person I made the reservation with over the phone AND the person who called to confirm my reservation, AND I wrote the restaurant back in their confirmation email to me that we are going for my boyfriend\\'s birthday. You can imagine my shock and disappointment when our captain and two other members of the team asked if we were celebrating anything tonight. Why yes, thank you for asking even though I mentioned it was my boyfriend\\'s birthday only three times before coming here. That kind of disorganized, silly mistake is never something that should happen at a restaurant of this caliber. I wouldn\\'t even expect that at a one-michelin star restaurant.\\n\\n- My boyfriend and I agree the worst offense (besides not knowing it was his birthday and asking twice) last night was the \"squab incident,\" as we now jokingly refer to it. One of the courses was squab, and it honestly wasn\\'t great. No, we are not picky eaters and we eat anything and everything (except junk food and processed food), however they need to replace the squab with another dish because it fell flat on so many levels. The taste was just not appealing and it paled in comparison to outstanding dishes such as the uni with black truffle or even the wagyu. We weren\\'t going to say anything about it, because it\\'s just a few bites and we were taking everything in. Our Captain asks us \"What did you think of the squab?\" and my boyfriend gives a very honest, concise response, \"It wasn\\'t my favorite.\" Our captain then says, \"what about it wasn\\'t to your liking, if I may ask?\" My boyfriend replies \"It\\'s not that it was bad, it\\'s just when you just had these phenomenal dishes like the uni, langoustine, wagyu, roe, fluke, etc., the squab isn\\'t anything special and just doesn\\'t stand out\"\\n\\nAs my boyfriend is literally MID-SENTENCE responding to the question the Captain asked, our Captain walks to another couple at the chef\\'s counter to take their photo! It was actually surreal. My boyfriend and I looked at each other like \"did that really just happen?\" For obvious reasons, walking away from someone as they\\'re talking mid-sentence is incredibly rude and unprofessional. It shows your priorities lie elsewhere, meanwhile we\\'re the ones paying almost $1,000 for this experience. At the very least, you can stick around and hear the answer you requested, no?\\n\\nAdditionally, one of the kitchen servers/runners (the person changing out our flatware throughout dinner) was very kind, however not the most suave. There was a lot of distracting, noisy clinking of flatware going on that was not necessary and could have been avoided with a little more finesse.\\n\\nThis place only has one bathroom. It\\'s not professional to keep guests waiting in line at that price point. Build a couple of more stalls, there is plenty of room.\\n',\n",
       " 'First my review:\\n\\nI ate here the first week of October with a bunch of friends. I will say it included the full experience, wine pairing, caviar and felt like everything was about the food.  The entire experience concentrates on the very best ingredients and impeccable service. While understandably I am at a chef\\'s table, by no means did I expect Chef Ramirez to step away from his duties and entertain me the entire time.  To think he would be is completely asinine.  While there is a strict rule of no notes or photos, I did manage to snap a few photos.  I also remember the entire beginning starting with fresh cuts of fish prepared in multiple different ways and ending with the nicest cut of wagyu from Japan.  If anything my main memory was of how decadent this meal was and that of all the 3 michelin stars I\\'ve been to, this was by far my best experience beyond even EMP (and I also went back to that kitchen and got a shaved ice treat) and have told numerous friend this as well.\\n\\nI mentioned in my first review, I did also leave my umbrella there, so if I could gladly give it back to you and I\\'ll give you back your \"15\" coat check tag.  :)\\n\\n\\nAs for all the other rumblings recently about this place:\\nThere were other Asian people in my group.  Never once did I feel like my experience was altered or pre-determined by my ethnicity.  The plating of the food is inherently set for random distribution as seen in pictures.  To suggest that the chef would tell his staff which plate to go where is kind of crazy.\\n\\nAdditionally, everyone makes notes of how Chef Ramirez did or did not treat them, but imagine that he\\'s making himself much more accessible than most other 3 star restaurants.  While it would be nice if he could interact with everyone at a meal you\\'re paying a ton of money for, it\\'s not necessary ( at least for me).  Cut him some slack.  \\n\\nFunny enough yelp deleted my previous review, even though I provided pictures of my first hand experience.\\n',\n",
       " \"My girlfriend and I have been lucky enough to have eaten at the Chef's Table twice within the past two months, the most recent of which was this past Saturday. \\n\\nNow, we all know the deal: \\n1.  It's impossible to get a reservation.\\n2.  If you happen to get one, they charge you an arm and a leg. \\n3.  Your arm and leg are payable one week in advance.\\n4.  No notes. No food pictures (womp womp).   \\n\\nAmidst all these things, all we really want to know is: Is it worth it?\\n\\nIn my humble opinion, absolutely YES.  \\n\\nThe meal encompasses 15+ courses, many of which are sashimi. I could list each course to map exactly what I had, but I don't think it will be an individual dish that will be most memorable.  What I'll remember is the overall balance, the clean flavors, the pace and progression of the meal, the full spectrum of flavor, the subtlety, the richness, the sights, the smells. Basically -- just delicious. \\n\\nWith that said, I do have a few favorite dishes. (i.e. Red Perch in Black Vinegar; Foie Gras/King Crab/Squash Dashi)\\n\\nThe wine list is extensive, but not overwhelming. As you'd imagine, vin blanc is king here.  The sommelier recommended a nice bottle at each of my visits, pairing well with both the food and the wallet.\\n\\nThe vibe may be slightly intimidating at first, given the aforementioned house rules and the 3* Michelin status, but once the show starts, that goes away pretty quickly. The staff was professional and very friendly, not at all stuffy. \\n\\nAs for Chef Ramirez, he is just a cool, down-to-earth guy. He comes off as a little quiet and intense, but will definitely do a few rounds around the room to chat with guests and ask about their meals. And obviously, the dude has skills.\\n\\nNow, assuming you're still interested in eating here, here's what to do:  \\n1. Exercise your re-dial finger. (Reserve.)\\n2. Save your pennies. (Pay.)\\n3. Turn off your cell phone and lose the notebook. (Eat.)\\n\\nThis is as amazing a dining experience as can be found in New York, or anywhere. I hope to make it back soon.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Food-wise, it\\'s like going to an actual nice restaurant like Per Se or Le Bernardin, though I found many of the dishes to repeat themes. However, it differs a good bit from those, aside from being even more expensive, in the level of rudeness and unprofessionalism of the wait staff and the misuse of the \"counter\" style. Good counter-style restaurants can be a real gem; take for example the counter restaurant at Roberta\\'s, Blanca. \\n\\nConversely, at Brooklyn Fare, you can expect servers to not-bother explaining dishes to you if you\\'re at the end of the line, as well as being treated to staff being obviously dressed-down while they\\'re standing right next to you in the open kitchen. The wine list is very pricey and way overshort; don\\'t expect any help there either, since the staff mostly seems to care about that I-banker who stores his $10,000 bottles of Burgundy at the restaurant. \\n\\nBrooklyn Fare demands you arrive the second doors open, but if you do, they\\'ll just make you wait outside. When you\\'re seated, don\\'t expect to be offered a glass of Champagne or any of the typical niceties, while you wait for the other diners who aren\\'t on time.\\n\\nIn general, there is nothing \"Brooklyn\" about this restaurant in terms of attitude or style; rather, it\\'s kind of the worst aspects of a very arrogant Manhattan restaurant. Actual good restaurants of this caliber make you feel welcomed and appreciated; at Brooklyn Fare, I felt they expect me to appreciate them.\\n\\nAs I said, this restaurant costs more than Per Se. By that standard, I would absolutely never consider visiting it again, while I plan to revisit Per Se and the like for many years to come.\\n',\n",
       " \"This is not going to be an essay because anything I write won't do the meal justice. You simply have to pray that you can get a reservation so that you can experience the genius of Chef Ramirez. Getting reservations here are very difficult and we were only able to get in by the grace of my friend's AMEX concierge service. \\n\\nThe meal was roughly 21 courses and featured an array of exotic fish served sashimi style with garnishing and various sauces. You will definitely eat something new when you visit, because it's unlikely that you've seen these fish on some other menu. We had some red trumpet fish and a deep sea fish to name a couple.\\n\\nWhat's awesome about this restaurant is that Chef Ramirez still cooks and is there every day. We were told that he wants to be there every day and isn't planning on going anywhere else. In some sense, he's like a modern day Jiro, except his cuisine is quite different. \\n\\nI think Chef's Table is probably one of the best, if not the best tasting menu in NYC at the moment. The service is top notch; Chef Ramirez even buses some dishes when he has some down time. Now where else would you see a 3-michelin star chef busing your dishes? Unheard of. I found it pretty cool because it just shows how down to earth Chef Ramirez is despite his notoriety and success.\\n\\nFor an tasting menu unlike any other, visit Chef's Table and prepared to be amazed.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Wow... best meal I have ever had.  So more about me. I\\'m on a quest to hit all the Michelin 3 star and 2 star restaurants in New York City (and other cities as well). \\n\\nPrior to this, Eleven Madison Park was my favorite restaurant, but Chef\\'s Table takes my new favorite as \"most intimate special meal.\"\\n\\nThe whole dinner was entirely different than anything I\\'ve experienced.  One \"enters\" the lab at the side of the Brooklyn Fare Grocery store and is seated in an industrial cooking kitchen.  It\\'s a bit chilly, so ladies, bring a sweater!   The chefs at work are your visual in addition to the food, and the kitchen is adorned by gleaming copper pots hanging above. \\n\\nSeating takes place in two stages with only 18 people having the privilege of dining here a night.  We had the earlier seating at 7 and had the wine paring (I think the experience will set you back $350-400 once you tip).  \\n\\nEach dish is a little morsel of delicious and I left the meal totally satisfied.  I\\'m not going to describe every dish (bc this is not my forte), but there is definitely a sashimi focus and a general fusion theme.  I had a brief chance to chat with Chef Cesar Ramirez on my way to the ladies (by the dishwashing station!) and he said he was inspired by his creations from his time in Japan. \\n\\nThe only downside of Chef\\'s Table is the impossibly difficult reservations.  They take reservations 1x a week for 6 weeks out and phone lines are jammed.  One has to prepay for dinner and its quite a chunk of change to shell out.  But if you think about it, one can easily drop $400 going to an average pre theater dinner and any show or the opera.   If you are a foodie, Chef\\'s Table is a must go to on the list.\\n',\n",
       " 'I was obviously hesitant about making, and then keeping reservations for Chef\\'s Table after the fallout of the accusations from a previous employee. But I was determined to make this restaurant the focal point of my trip. After seeing this restaurant and its food in the Brooklyn episode of No Reservations, I was set on coming, regardless of cost and the difficulty of securing a reservation. And I\\'m glad (as is my wife) we came.\\n\\nThe service was warm and friendly, and the sommelier was attentive and helpful. The server was friendly, engaging, and attentive. While the chef is certainly mild mannered and soft spoken, he was engaging to my wife and I. We were lucky enough to score the action seats next to the chef. Maybe it was because we told them it was out 4th wedding anniversary that evening...or maybe I dialed the phone like crazy at exactly 1030 EST 6 months from the day of our reservation. It is obvious Chef Ramirez is passionate and particular about the ingredients he uses, the method of preparation for each dish, and the presentation of the food. Overall, the service was spot on. \\n\\nWe had too many dishes and I was enjoying my wife\\'s company so my intent was not to remember every meal and recall the precise method of preparation or the ingredients used. Although every dish was phenomenal, I do recall a few dishes that were very memorable.\\n\\nThere was a black cod dish that was so delicate and buttery. The fish melts away in your mouth. There was, of course, the uni and black truffle on brioche. It was a great dish, but surprisingly not my favorite of the night. My favorite was the wild dover sole with cauliflower puree and radish. I loved the liveliness they brought to the puree and how it paired so well with the delicate sole. We are served a sisho and coconut sorbet as a palate cleanser which was surprisingly very good. There was a hint of the viney-ness from the shiso, but it was the perfect intermission between the rich entree (duck breast with a stuffed morel) and the upcoming dessert courses.\\n\\nThe most memorable dish of the night was the second-to-last dessert dish. Again, I wasn\\'t paying too much attention to the preparation of the dish, but it was essentially a gelato dusted with cocoa powder. The sous chef proceeded to top that off with something resembling a pink muffin. I was a bit taken back and very confused at this point. The server saw my reaction, smirked slightly and said \"This goes quickly.\" I was left even more confused.\\n\\nWhen I took my first bite, I was absolutely overwhelmed. The \"muffin\" disappeared. It didn\\'t melt in my mouth...it just disappeared and I was left with an explosion of flavor. Amazingly innovative and most definitely creative. What a way to end the meal of a lifetime.\\n\\nI\\'d like to address some of the other points made in previous reviews. While they make every effort to prevent excess noise from stack and clearing of plates, this place is not devoid of sound. There is soft music playing in the background, you hear the sizzle of pans and crackle of the wood charcoal, the murmuring of the chef and sous chefs, soft chatter of the other guests, and the clinking of forks against porcelain. Yes, there is a lack of decor in the restaurant, but the simple utilitarian look is itself very pleasing. It\\'s functional and reminds you that you are there for nothing else but the food and wine. \\n\\nAnd while the server, chef, and sommelier do not chat it up with you between dishes, they are friendly and courteous when you engage them. The chef always asked what we thought of each dish, as did the server in the middle. I do not expect for them to carry on a conversation with me when there is certainly a lot that needs to be done for every service. There is very little down time for each of them and we respected their space and time.  \\n\\nI\\'m surprised to find this many 1 and 2* reviews. I understand that this type of food isn\\'t for everybody (we saw some unfinished dishes from our neighbors...an absolute crime!), but the evening must have been a horrible trainwreck to warrant anything less than 4*. And it seems highly unlikely that this place does not put forth it\\'s best effort each and every service.\\n',\n",

But if you're able to get past those things and wholly devote yourself to watching a master at work, you'll be rewarded with one of the most incredible meals you'll ever have the privilege of experiencing in your lifetime.\\n\\nChef Ramirez, a Bouley disciple, has worked his way up through the industry to earn Chef's Table a three Michelin-star rating.  In an era of celebrity chefs who focus more on their TV careers than their food, he is unabashedly old-school.  He only wants to do what he loves doing - cooking.  \\n\\nIt's easy to see the Japanese and French influences on his cuisine.  His meals begin with small slivers of sashimi, each piece meticulously prepared and served on beautiful china, all for the fleeting pleasure of a single bite.  His attention to detail is extraordinary -- of the edible flowers the restaurant procures, he hand-picks each one that graces your plate.  Judging by the amount of caviar he serves per person, it's hard to imagine how the restaurant actually makes a profit.  You get the sense that the chef could care less.  Towards the middle of the meal come exquisitely-prepared pieces of uni, wagyu and duck that embody gastronomic perfection.   \\n\\nNot unlike watching a play or attending a concert, there's a rhythm to every meal at Chef's Table, and Chef Ramirez runs the show.

       " 'Brooklyn Fare and Chef Cesar Ramirez,\\nI would like to start by thanking you for the best meal and overall dining experience that my wife and I have ever had. The outstanding food, the laser focused service, the brilliant setup, the wine glasses/plates/cutlery, the aromas, the privaledge of getting to watch the masterful cooking and preparation up close and personal: all simply amazing. So let me elaborate:\\n\\nThe Scene\\nWe had 9:55 reservations on a Thursday and were instructed to be on time. Brooklyn Fare\\'s \"dining kitchen\" can be seen through a wide open window from the front with patrons sitting around the chefs and staff on a steel table that wraps around. Pots hang from the ceiling - the kitchen is the dining room. The 9pm group were already sitting - a total of 18 seats are available across both seatings. We entered and were fortunate to get placed right next to the grills and stoves on the corner: a first hand view of the fresh fish, meats, foie gras, vegetables etc., coming out of fridges, searing in pans or meticulously being prepared for several perfect bites. The scents wafting around were intoxicating and somewhat torturous since the 9pm seating was eating already and the 955s could only watch and drool. Chef Ramirez is highly engaged and presides over everything - the prepping, the cooking, the plating, \\xa0the serving. The reviews that say he doesn\\'t talk or is cold are completely false. He spoke to us quite a bit and was very friendly but he is also clearly focused on the food and the experience being provided to his customers. This is a 3 Michelin star restaurant people! You come for the genius and it is delivered on a platter...or a snow globe (more on that later). I digress...back to the scene. The staff are highly professional and efficient and yes quiet! There is very little clinking of plates and glasses - they cleverly place cloth between the plates and glasses go face down on cloth so that the only sounds you consistently hear are the searing and crackling from the cooking and the murmur of conversation from guests. The main host - who was terrific - asks specific questions about what you can eat and controls the delivery and communication about each dish and the sommelier as well engages around wine choices but for the most part your senses get to focus on the food. Oh yeah and NO CELL PHONES which as a Yelper is crazy but it does truly add to the experience and allows you and the guests to focus on the sounds, sights and taste of the food. Truth be told my iphone photos wouldn\\'t do justice to the art that was put in front of us ... so you can respect Brooklyn Fare wanting to control how its dishes are presented as well as the undistracted ambiance. Apple does the same thing in a way - they control the user experience to ensure that the experience is enjoyable and consistent and Brooklyn Fare does the same thing in many ways.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Food\\nChef Ramirez is clearly proud of his product: the quality of the ingredients and skill in which his food is prepared. He studied masters in Japan and credits those masters\\' focus on quality with his approach to ingredients. In addition know that when you come to Brooklyn Fare although it\\'s not cheap - you get what you pay for. Heaps of caviar, white truffle and fois gras, innovation and as previously mentioned a carefully crafted unique experience. So what did we eat? Note taking is not allowed but I literally recited every dish we had - at least the main ingredient - to myself and my wife and here is what I can recall:\\n- Wine Pairing (4) of 1 Riesling, 2 Chardonnay, 1 Granache and 1 sweet Riesling\\n- Butterfish\\n- Perch\\n- Tuna\\n- Snapper\\n- Abalone\\n- Oyster\\n- Sea urchin on toast\\xa0\\n- Caviar with applewood smoke in a snow globe\\n- Foie gras squash soup with mushrooms\\n- Fresh Bread\\xa0\\n- Lobster\\xa0\\n- White truffle fried rice\\n- Duck with beets and squash\\n- Wagyu beef\\n-Shiso ice cream\\n- Shobasa ice cream\\n- Grapefruit ice cream\\n- Espresso\\xa0\\n- Chocolate truffle\\n\\nI hope I\\'m lucky enough to go to Brooklyn Fare again. Once again chef, thank you!\\n',\n",
       " \"We've been there for a dinner last week. We booked party of 4 and everything was OK. I thought this will be a formal sit down dinner rather than a food sampling / tasting. The food was OK, nothing special. They tend to focus more on seafood than American dish. Little overrated online...probably due to the location and the name.\\nWe won't be back though. Too far of a drive just to experience some seafood tasting.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Chef\\'s table was more than a dinner to me.  It was like watching a live art show where you see the artist painting live on a blank canvas.  With only 18 seats (I believe) and serving half the seats at a time, there is detail and love put into every bite sized dish.  \\n\\nWhen I walked in, I was blinded by the squeaky clean shine the kitchen exuded.  All stainless steel including the horse shoe shaped counter us patriots dinned on. \\n\\nI had heard there are about 18 to 20 bite sized portions served.  This made me a be skeptical as to, if I\\'d need to stop by the near by McDonalds and super size my Fish\\'O filet to be satisfied.  Like Golielocks said, \"it was just rite!\"  I wouldn\\'t want any more or less.  \\n\\nEach bite was an explosion of favors.  Trying to detect what each taste was is part of the fun!  The sorbet that prepped my palate for the next course was green and reminded me of sushi.  Why did this sweet sorbet remind me of sushi?  Ahhhh, the Shiso leaf I sometimes wrap my sashimi in was in play!  Who woulda thunk that green leaf would make such an awesome sorbet?!\\n\\nMy favorite dish and I mean favorite!!  I\\'m still have dreams about it... was brioche topped with uni and (drum roll).... shaved black truffle.  I peed in my seat with excitement!!  Spectacular!!!  I was trying to scheme up a plan to get the other diners bite size as well.\\n\\nChef\\'s Table is not to be missed.  Yes you may get carpal tunnel from hitting redial button trying to get that impossible reservation, but its worth it!!  I\\'ve dinned all over the world and have never had such an avant garde dinning experience as this.  Don\\'t miss out!\\n',\n",
       " \"Although expensive, this place is worth a trip.  The thirteen-course dinner is different and inspired.  The service is generally flawless.  The sommelier is knowledgeable and helpful and the list is only 3-4 times the restaurant's cost.  Worth a trip but not sure that we will return.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Dont know where to start, but to make it simply its an experience, not just dinning experience but overall life experience. Food is amazing, Service is great. Every dish you get is a masterpiece, from presentation to the moment it hits your tong. Even after you get your bill you still dont regret spending this much money, ones again not on a meal but experience. I read some reviews and feel that some of us are just not cut for it, I assume it's a cultural thing, but I will let you decide. Definitely recommend it. \\n\\nMichelin wont even step in his door if he was NOT THE BEST.\\n\",\n",

With only 16 seats available, prepared to rub elbows with the other diners. Everyone is courteous though so I wouldn't worry about noise level. The host is warm and accommodating. I'm a fan of the open kitchen - watching chefs prepare my meal in front of me is an incredible experience in itself.\\n\\nFood - I've been to a few Michelin stars and the only two places I walk out of singing praise were here and Keiko in SF. They perfected the science and art in each course. I particularly like the heavy use of seafood, it helps keep you palate fresh until the end. \\n\\nService - like mentioned earlier, the host was professional and welcoming. Server was very helpful in wine recommendation, which can be a challenge given the restaurant's extensive wine list. Chef Caser Ramirez came to check on us during the meal. \\n\\nOne word for the gentlemen who forget their jackets - don't run out and buy a jacket! They have jackets to loan at the restaurant :)\\n\\nWill definitely come back another time.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I went to Chef's Table for my birthday dinner last weekend and it was fantastic. The whole experience was unforgettable. My favorite course was a caviar dish with potato.

It was, hands down, the best meal experience of my life.  I think it, say it, and proclaim it... often.  Chef's Table set that bar for me.  But you know what, I'm ok with that.  Maybe it's my age, but I'm thankful that I finally had that experience where I'm not preoccupied with searching for the next big deal.  I was damn lucky to get the opportunity (the stars were aligned that Monday morning when I called the reservation line) and I appreciated the incredible experience in every way.\\n\",\n",

It is worth every single penny to experience this at least once before you die.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Hubs and I basically won the lottery by getting a reservation on a Saturday at 10 on my actual birthday due to a cancellation. It was basically us and a handful of other couples sitting at a counter watching the chefs in their open kitchen so its an intimate experience. The setting is very sparse and minimal so the focus is entirely on the food. The chef and his team work like a well oiled machine turning out delicious bites. \\n\\nThe menu was sashimi-heavy and I found myself wanting maybe a few more meat or veggie courses but thats really my only criticism.  A lot of fish I never heard of with a tart or citrusy sauce and something crunchy appeared to be the formula here and it worked. Probably the freshest and best variety you can find. \\n\\nWe also opted for the wine pairing which was about 6 glasses to the 20 some courses.  It was just enough to complement the meal while still allowing us to navigate the subway home.\\n',\n",

       " 'It\\'s really hard for me to write this review. Why? Because not only were we not allowed to take photos during the meal, we were also not allowed to take notes and for a meal without a menu and more than 3 courses, well...The food had complex flavors, there were items I had not had before and the presentation was 5 stars - there were so many different little flowers that were almost too pretty to eat (too bad I can\\'t appreciate it in retrospect through photos). Sadly the items I had not had before in Japanese will possibly also be forgotten because I couldn\\'t jot it down. The negatives are the no picture/no note taking policy (obviously & still having withdrawal); the reservation which must be made 6 weeks in advance; the price of the meal (which one pays for almost a week in advance); and some of the staff (maybe they were concentrating really hard on their tasks but it did come off like they were scowling; also, for the price of the meal and no notes, I think I would\\'ve liked a bit more detail about the food we were eating; although any follow-up questions are answered). \\nMy fav - hmmmm that\\'s a toughie because there were so many tasty items but my least favorite was the goat cheese/kumquat (but I am not a huge goat cheese person). Most interesting dessert was what I call the \"Death Star\" - fresh strawberries and butterscotch ice cream over some kind of chocolate cake inside a chocolate spherical shell which then has hot chocolate strawberry sauce poured over it - it literally starts to melt in front of your eyes & looks like the battered Death Star. Again without notes or pix, I believe we had ~17 courses: stellar bay oyster with white ponzu & cucumber, 3 Japanese fish - sashimi style (all VERY delicious & one had puff rice seared on top), abalone, wagyu beef, uni with slice of black truffle over brioche, cauliflower puree with caviar (good portion) & a thinly sliced baguette, soup with corn, Alaskan king crab & foie gras (good portions), lobster (with celery foam; carrot citrus sauce & tiny carrot & turnip - so cute), squab (with a dollop of duck liver & red onion/shallot), turbot (with a dollop of pesto zucchini; roasted mini tomatoes & cucumber), goat cheese/kumquat topped with bread crumbs?, shiso sorbet, yogurt with apricot & lemon thyme jelly, the \"Death Star\" and petit fours (lemony financier, caramel chocolate & chocolate tart with gold foil).  The bread was not baked on site (Balthazar).\\nWithout the pix and notes, there were less distractions and one could concentrate more on the food and table conversation.  People really come from afar to eat here.  It was amazing that near us were people from San Francisco, Houston & Toronto. The restaurant has a trendy vibe and the tableware was very modern, white & changed with what was being served. Although I was not hungry when I left the restaurant, I don\\'t think quantity of food was indicative of the price; however the ingredients seemed to be of high caliber.\\n',\n",
       " \"Short answer: What an experience!\\n\\nOh gosh, where to start?! I suppose the food, first: Cesar Ramirez (who was literally five feet away for half the meal) expertly crafts some of the most luscious, tongue-tinglingly good bites. Each course (of which there are about 15) is far too short, but only because each bite leaves you desperate for more (that uni and truffle course...). But you don't pay this much for just the food--you pay because the stainless steel decor and service make you believe that you're in the hands of an all-star cast and crew. You'll see your chefs slaving over each morsel of food, spending 5 minutes making something that'll go from plate to tummy in less than 5 seconds (specifically referring to the dessert course with about 50 tiny meringues topping a meyer tart). You'll feel incredibly welcomed by the excellent servers, sommelier, and the maitre d' in the middle of the table serving up food worthy of the highest praises. And again, the fact that you're max 10 feet away from the action and can see all the sausage making  makes it all that much more special. \\n\\nIf you're interested in tasting at the top end of the business, Cesar's table is hard to beat.\\n\",\n",

Whenever you are able to go somewhere and see the amount of passion for the food being made, you know you will love it.\\n\\nGetting a reservation is as tough as you would think, for me at least. Both times I was only able to get a reservation and wait two months before having the chance to dine. Once you do get a reservation and step into the small restaurant (given that you are able to find it), you can't help but think what kind of experience lies ahead. \\n\\nThe restaurant as all others have expressed is an open concept kitchen with a U-shaped bar that diners fill up according to their reservation time. Half of the restaurant (one reservation time) is served at a time. You are more than likely going to meet fellow foodies here since this is definitely more of a social type restaurant compared to other 3 Michelin starred restaurants. \\n\\nChef Ramirez is a visionary and he ensures all of his patrons enjoy what is being served, definitely very serious about the experience. They have a former Per Se sommelier on their staff and a very professional and engaging team.\\n\\nEvery course was great, you leave feeing very full. High highlight course is the Uni brioche with truffle. I could easily eat 100 of these. WOW!!!\\n\\nWe had 26 courses, an experience I will gladly do again and again with that someone special or a valued business partner or friend.

I am so glad I sucked it up, saved my dollars, and made it in here.\\n\\nThere is nothing about the meal that has not already been mentioned in the reviews, but I will add that your attitude towards the meal goes a long way.  The dinner is very reminiscent of an Omakase style Japanese meal, which makes perfect sense due to the amount of Japanese influence in the dishes (i.e. Sashimi).  Therefore, it is an absolute must that you come in with the mindset that you are willing to try anything or you will miss out.\\n\\nI guess I got \"lucky\" in that I was able to chat with Chef Cesar himself and our server on multiple occasions during the evening.

Everything.  And I mean EVERYTHING is top notch when it comes to quality.  I was very curious about his food sources and was pleasantly surprised to learn that every ingredient was flown in from a place that specializes in that particular item.  Imagine crafting a masterpiece where you only used the top 1% of each item to ensure the quality.  That is exactly what you get at the Chef\\'s Table.

       " \"It's like dinner theatre.  There's an open kitchen with 18 people sitting around it.  After eating here, I wondered why couldn't all restaurants do this?  It felt so natural.  The atmosphere wasn't stuffy at all (as I would have expected from a 3-Michelin star place).  Part of this was probably due to the background music, which consisted mostly of the Doors that night, making the ambiance casual.  Also, despite the close proximity of diners to each other, people weren't afraid to converse during the dinner.  \\nThe service was so fantastic.  It was a perfectly choreographed show involving all of the servers. Someone went around collecting the utensils after each course, the hostess in the middle collected the dishes.  The chefs plated each course in a line.  It was so fascinating to watch the efficiency of it all.\\n\\nThe food, of course, was amazing and beautiful.  The starting courses were my favorite of the night.  There was this uni dish that was probably my favorite.  (I don't even like uni normally!!)  A good number of the dishes had freshly shaved truffle on them.  One of the desserts was a truffle-flavored ice cream with truffle shaving!!  Chef Ramirez started with a huge truffle at the beginning of the night, and by the end it was shaved down to almost nothing.  Oh man, every time he went at it with the truffle, I felt like a star-struck teen at a Bieber concert.  \\n\\nMy partner and I shared the wine pairing (since neither of us are big drinkers).

The service was very good, but not as good as some of the Michelin three stars restaurants. The atmosphere was ok, I guess you come here and really want to watch the chefs cooking. It is cool but if you really want romantic atmosphere, it is definitely not for you. I sat just next to the kitchen, as a result, my hair and my dress was soaked a lot kitchen smell, felt very embarrassed  to walk around after dinner.  Also the smoke from the kitchen made my eyes teary.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I'm pretty sure Chef's Table has to be the hardest get of the high-end restaurants in NYC, given the absolutely cozy size (18 seats total) of the restaurant. I've called in at 9:30 AM sharp on Monday morning, and I never get through. So I called in one afternoon and put myself on the waitlist for any day, any time - and a month afterward, when I'd long forgotten about the call, I got the Holy Grail - a couple seats for a 9:30 PM seating on Thursday night. The entrance to the restaurant is not that noticeable - I nearly walked right by it once I got off the subway. I think I was mesmerized when I stepped in, because I totally missed Chef Ramirez standing right there, greeting everyone who was coming in, as well as everyone who was finishing up. He seems quite soft-spoken, and when the dinner's being made, he is generally keeping a close eye on everything that's being prepped. That said, if you are lucky enough to score seats closer to the action, he definitely was chatting those people up more than us (who were seated just about dead center from the cooking).\\n\\nIt's hard to describe the food, because a lot of it is something you'll never have had before. Definitely oriented towards seafood, but with a distinct lean towards Asian (particularly Japanese) flavors. It's very much like Le Bernardin - focusing on the seafood, with one meat dish at the end. That said - there is magic being concocted in front of you, and having it all done in front of you is amazing. You know you're in for a good meal when they smoke up a small glass bowl and bring you an applewood-smoked oyster as your first dish (I don't know if I've ever had a smoked oyster, much less one with that much intense smoky, delicious flavor). The start of the meal, in my opinion, is the real tour de force - after the oyster, you're hit with bluenose sashimi, which is served with a phenomenal shiso sauce (captures the flavor, but without the strong intensity of the leaf itself) and crispy kelp to add a dash of saltiness. The sea perch comes next, with a black vinegar that pairs off really well. My favorite dish had to be the uni with a slice of black truffle on top. I think truffle makes just about anything better, but with the rich, ocean-salty flavor of the uni - it's pure magic. You're then hit with a cauliflower soup served with a generous helping of caviar - and I do mean generous! Most restaurants will give you a tiny amount, but Chef Ramirez cracks open 3 cans when serving everyone. Next was his take on chawanmushi - with a much more viscous egg custard (if you can even call it that), with a piece of foie gras to richen it up.\\n\\nAfter this, you start getting into dishes with bigger portions. The golden eye snapper was prepared so well, with the highlight being the crispy skin of the fish that just melts apart in your mouth. You get a hearty slice of wild turbot next, which was really juicy and succulent, covered in a roasted potato foam - but the highlight could very well be the brussel sprouts. Instead of getting the dense sprouts, they're decomposed into their individual peels, yet they retain the same rich flavor. The lobster was next, which was surprisingly one of the less memorable dishes. If anything I really loved the bouillabaisse reduction that coated the fresh tail meat. A small pause for Japanese rice with white truffle (Chef Ramirez shaves off a hearty amount for this), which basically tastes like a fantastic macaroni and cheese, but with a different texture. A slice of abalone is next (perhaps my least favorite dish, more because it wasn't as memorable than because it was not good), followed the only meat dish - a seriously fatty slice of Kobe beef, served with grated daikon to temper the juiciness.\\n\\nThe desserts themselves were also incredibly done. We got a slice of Brie-like sheep's milk cheese served with yuzu marmalade - a great pairing of the creamy and the acidic. Next was shiso sorbet, which was perfectly done - it has the deep green of the leaf, and a stronger flavor of shiso than other similar sorbets - but without the bite of the leaf. My favorite had to be the white truffle ice cream(!) with a dash of caramel and more white truffle (in the form of shavings)...it very much has a savory flavor, but it works so well in what is typically a sweet dish. Paired with the caramel, and it is a scoop of pure heaven. We finished up with a chocolate and vanilla truffle (which seemed like the coating was made from rice), paired with deliciously unsweetened soba ice cream.\\n\\nThe creativity of the dishes is incredible, and were it not for the impossible nature of getting a seat, and the fact that this burns a big fat hole in your wallet ($650+ for 2 including tax and service charge - before any wine), I would be back in a heartbeat. It's not just for having a fresh memory, but Chef's Table (as of now - there's a lot more food out there) is my new favorite restaurant. You watch a masterpiece being built - and then you eat each and every one.\\n\",\n",

It was the best meal that either one of us had in our life!! It's very obvious how passionate Chef Cesar is about his dishes when watching him and his staff prepare our 15 course meal. It was such a treat to interact with his staff! We cannot wait to go back despite the price because it was THAT good! Definitely make your way there!\\n\",\n",
       " 'unbelievable experience. not worthy to have a dinner here. poor environment, poor restroom. Poor foods just like the grills on the street.\\n',\n",
       " \"I wish I had finished this review earlier, cause now I have forgotten most of the details!\\n\\nYou need to make reservation way ahead of time to eat there, and they are not cheap. Not cheap is probably an understatement, they are hella expensive! But I'd say it's absolutely worth it!\\n\\nFirst impression wasn't too good. I forgot what time was our reservation, like late at night. Did I say that you need to make reservation way ahead of time, we tried. But first try was a failure, then we tried again the follow week, and I think we got two spots for like 10 at night or something. But anyway, we got their at like 9:45 and we were basically got kicked out because we were too early. It was cold, we were hungry and we got kicked out and told to come back when it's 10, 10 is 10, dang it, not 9:45!!\\n\\nThe place was nice, it's a stainless steel open kitchen where you sit there and watch food getting prepared right in front of you, in the kitchen, pretty cool and impressive.\\n\\nPictures were not allowed, so with my little brain I don't remember much details and what we ate. We had like 15 courses? something like that. All the sashimi and raw stuff were served first, then there's the main dishes, and there were like 4 or 5 dessert. All I got to say is they are absolutely amazing! Like how can people even come up with stuff like that? everything just match so well and it's like magic in your mouth. The absolutely worst part is everything is bite size! OMG, when that little thing was being served, it's like a piece of art, but it's so small but so good that you want MORE MORE MORE AND MORE!!\\n\\nAnyhow, this review is probably not that helpful, but it's was my experience, an amazing experience. \\n\\nWell, will I go back, I'd love to, but at that price tag, I would try something else, maybe other Michelin restaurant when we go back to NYC again. Or if I won the lottery, I will definitely go again.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I have waited a long time to go to Brooklyn fare chefs table I booked a few weeks ago when it was in its old location but then they moved quickly to the new location. The new location is excellent it feels more spacious and allows you comfort while watching the amazing chefs at work producing mouth watering food with ease. When we arrived the head chef/owner greeted us with a warm welcome made us feel comfortable and ready for an amazing meal. The whole experience from watching the chefs at work to the food tasting was amazing I loved the experience. Amazing precise food with a warm welcome. All of the food was amazing and different but for me the mackerel and the crab dish were amazing. My wonderful boyfriend does not eat deserts but he eat the frozen soufflé and the small lemon cakes and said he would eat them again so amazing the soufflé vanishes in your mouth but leaves behind amazing flavours . I will book again very soon \\n\\nThe only slight negative was we ordered the wine pairing but the sommelier was very busy and we definitely missed at least one pairing it wasn't a big issue to be honest as the pairings we did get were excellent choices. I should have asked for another wine but I was happy just watching the food prep and tasting. \\n\\nThank you\\n\",\n",
       " \"Chef's table was the best meal I've ever eaten. Hand's down. Easily besting Alinea, EMP, the french laundry etc. The setting is cool - 18 seats around a chef's kitchen and service is impeccable, but everything pales in comparison to the show stealing food that is served course after course. I was so blown away after the meal that I texted a food minded friend after the meal to ask her the top 5 most extravagant ingredients that she could name. Lo and behold I had eaten all 5 of them (and a lot more) at Chef's Table. Amazing - no other place has come close. If you have a special occasion of any kind to celebrate, this is the place to do it (just make sure you plan well enough in advance..)\\n\\nThe only flaws with this place are:\\n1) how unbelievably full you leave feeling\\n2) how insanely difficult it is to get a reservation\\n\\nBut then those arent real flaws :)\\n\",\n",
       " 'Graciously accepted an invitation to join a party of 4 at 9:30pm on a Thursday. It felt like winning the lottery. I\\'m all too nervous and unsure about my ability to truly describe the experience in words, but I don\\'t really have a choice...so here it goes:\\n\\nAtmosphere: the open layout of the restaurant was new to me, but much appreciated. I was concerned that the bar style stools would be uncomfortable, but they picked out the perfect ones. Our fellow diners were amicable and insisted on waiting to consume until everyone in our 8-person crew received their food. #manners\\n\\nWine: Sommelier was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations. We chose to stick with whites because all but 2 dishes were seafood. Started with a tremendous White Burgundy, then an Austrian Gruner Veltliner, and polished it all off with some Madeira with dessert. After seeing the bill, we should have just gone with the tasting, but c\\'est la vie.\\n\\nFood: Can\\'t stress enough how important it is that you arrive on time because service begins promptly and you don\\'t want to miss a single dish (tsk tsk diners who arrived 10 minutes late). The most memorable and overwhelming majority of dishes are seafood, and Chef Ramirez is a master with the sea critters. The black truffle Uni dish stands out in particular, as well as the Japanese \"soup\" dish with foie gras. Every item, although small and deliberately bite size, is tremendous. However, the last two dishes before dessert, while good, did not measure up to the seafood dishes. The squab and Wagyu beef seemed to be lacking a certain redeeming quality, but in retrospect, I do have to admit the squab was well cooked. Dessert was on par with the rest of the meal...I was dazzled by the sugar snow globe creation.\\n\\nOverall: Definitely recommend dining here, especially if you are fortunate enough to grab a reservation. As far as dining establishments that I hold in high regard, Chef\\'s Table is right up there with Daniel and the dearly departed Gordon Ramsay\\'s at Claridges.\\n',\n",
       " 'Chef\\'s Table Review\\n\\nI had been trying to get a reservation at Chef\\'s Table for over 6 months. You can only call between 10 am and 2 pm on Mondays only and that does make it hard. So, imagine my surprise when I finally got through and had someone on the phone. Who then told me that they only had room for a four top. Would I like to book that? Sure why not. I\\'m sure I could find another couple to join us.\\n\\nOnly when the day came, they had a family conflict and had to cancel. I had a week, shouldn\\'t be a problem, no? This restaurant has a waiting list. Only they refused. So I reached out to everyone I could, came up empty. Again, I reached out to the restaurant. They said they would do their best - ask the chef, anyone who might have people who wanted to come in. Then he forgot to tell me that he had come up empty. So yeah. In the end, I went there as a two top, but paid for a four top (in the end, over $1000). They refused to refund the two empty seats. And no, they didn\\'t give us bigger portions either.\\n\\nSo. This gets better. Brooklyn Fare is adamant about you being on time. So we showed up 15 minutes early, which apparently was too early. They weren\\'t ready. So they offered that we could sit in a waiting area in the grocery store next door. Remember the dress code? Formal. In the past, the chef has sent people to a nearby store to purchase clothes when he deems them under dressed. So. Ever want to feel like a complete jerk? Try walking around a grocery store on Schermerhorn in a suit. Then sit in a small waiting area next to the check out lanes.\\n\\nFinally they\\'re ready for us and we sit. The room its self is tight, but theatrically well laid out, with a massive rack of copper cookware framing the kitchen. The staff is decked out in crisp linens and everything felt in order. We were unceremoniously sat down to a clean and modern setting complete with Ercuis flatware and FoH porcelain. We then had an initial chat with the sommelier who introduced us to a shallow and overpriced wine list. We asked for a recommendation for a glass that would work well with the first few plates and she picked out a Sauvignon Blanc. When she went to the glass caged wine rack, Chef César intercepted her, had a quick chat with her and pointed her to a different bottle. Which she then presented to us and poured. Without mentioning that it was different than what she had recommended. It was a Sancerre. Quite a bit different.\\n\\nThe first dish was then placed in front of us without explanation by the single server working the center of the pass. A lovely bite of a clean Tomato sorbet with a wonderful tang of Lemongrass. It exploded with a delicate melange of flavor that was sweet, sour, clean and beautiful all at once. In my head I growled \"Damn you Chef César, despite all of this, you\\'re going to win me over.\" But that was to be the highlight of the evening. What followed was mostly a series of well sourced but uninspired plates. As it was summer, sashimi dominated the 14 plates we experienced, (a far cry from the lauded \"20 small plate courses\"), most of which while fresh, were sometimes flat in flavor. And my partner who is gluten intolerant merely saw all of the gluten removed from the dishes I was served, rather than a rethinking.\\n\\nNot to say that it was all for naught. While the evening provided us with few highlights there were actual highlights. The aforementioned Tomato and Lemongrass sorbet and a brilliant mouthful of Uni and black truffle, unguent and delicate, both lived up to the reputation. \\n\\nWith the final dessert plates, we were offered our choice of espresso based drink. Oily and black and bitter on the tongue, the bean was over roasted, but moreover, the shots had been burned, most likely because they had been overpacked and then pulled with very little crema which indicates they were overlong and watery.\\n\\nIn the end, what we experienced was not a chef\\'s table at all. The chef walked around the seats once, slapped me on the shoulder and walked off. And that was it. He put a lot of smears across plates, added some garnish, but that was the extent of his performance. Our server had to be repeatedly asked about the food, which she would then describe in a quick and straightforward manner, devoid of any desire for enhancing the experience for us. And when we asked about the caviar, she told us that it was \"Osteria Caviar, farmed in China.\" Which, at Per Se prices, frankly shocked us that they would (a) serve such a product and (b) describe it as though it was premium. As a final insult, on our way out, a couple asked the servers to call them a taxi - they were told that they could hail a yellow cab anywhere on the street.\\n\\n3 Michelin Stars? Never. Again. Go to Atera where chef Matthew Lightner delivers on the promise of what a Chef\\'s Table can be. Or Blue Hill at Stone Barns where Dan Barber has consistently provided me with the best food I\\'ve ever eaten. Or 15 East which IMHO serves the best Japanese food in NYC.\\n',\n",
       " \"Still my most favorite NYC restaurant!! \\n\\nI've been to Brooklyn Fare twice now. First time, was 3 years ago, when we celebrated a friend's birthday and I thought it was the best meal ever. Everything was light, citrusy and incredibly tasty, flavorful and yet simple...it felt like all the small bites were just catered to my palate. \\n\\nFrom experience, I normally enjoy the first visits to a restaurant, finding them to be amazing and almost always do I find the same restaurant to be lacking after returning a year or two later.  \\n\\nBut this was not the case here.  I returned recently and found them to be exceptional.  Better if not the same...though I think their style changed slightly. I found their dishes to be heartier now and they were all well executed.  Their raw bites were still refreshing and citrusy as I have remembered it to be. \\n\\nOh and reservations wasn't so hard to get the second time around!\\n\",\n",
       " '3/17/12\\nDamn it.\\nI cursed to myself as I stared at the clock on the N express. 7:15pm.\\nMy 7:45pm reservation tonight was at Brooklyn\\'s only 3 Michelin star restaurant called Chef\\'s Table - Brooklyn Fare. Connected to a grocery store, 50 gleaming copper pots hung above an immaculate stainless steel seating area that holds 18 highly coveted seats for a 3 hour, 25-course prix-fixe adventure that sets you back $225.\\n\\n7:25pm\\nThe subway lurched forward with no urgency. The bum sitting across from me in a drunken stupor cocked his head ever so slightly. César Ramirez, the chef at Brooklyn Fare was known to be mercurial in nature. One minute, expounding on the history behind his prized truffle collection, the next minute, berating a customer for taking notes by shouting, \"You think you will be able to cook like me? No! Nobody can cook like me!\"\\nA few minutes later, I was jogging at a steady clip from Brooklyn Flea to Hoyt-Schermerhorn, the street where the restaurant resided. I noticed my companion, Sammy Lee, pacing outside the entrance while nervously puffing a Marlboro menthol light. He had a beige blazer, dark jeans, and sneakers. My outfit wasn\\'t much different: black leather biker jacket, black polo t-shirt, stone gray corduroys, and adidas to fulfill the casual dress code mentioned on Yelp.\\n\\n7:50pm.\\nSammy and I entered the rain canopy and pulled at the restaurant door. Locked. Sammy pulled harder and the metal clang of the lock reverberated throughout the room which made the diners pause. The maitre d\\', wearing a tight heather gray blazer rushed over to us, her dirty blonde ponytail bouncing. After unlocking the door and showing us in, she mentioned that the first few canapés have been served and the chef would be forging onwards. I made my way to the restroom to freshen up after my 8 minute jog. I opened the door to see Sammy\\'s crestfallen face.\\n\"There\\'s a dress code, we have to go change.\"\\nThis wasn\\'t the right time to play jokes on each other.\\n\"Ha, real funny, hurry up so we can eat.\"\\n That\\'s when I noticed the maître d\\' next to him, standing upright, ponytail unmoving.\\n \"Sir, we do have a dress policy. No jeans and sneakers allowed.\"\\n At this point, I thought they were in cahoots.\\n \"Wait...seriously?\" I asked incredulously.\\n (Pause) \"Yes, do you live close to here?\\n Crap. She wasn\\'t bluffing. The realization hit me hard. The longer we waited, the more courses we\\'d be missing.\\n***\\nThe cool night breeze felt good against our sweaty foreheads as we pounded the pavement. Luckily, my apt was 2 blocks away. I found a pair of navy blue pinstripe slacks and chocolate brown loafers for Sammy. I quickly changed into a light blue gingham shirt and slate gray trousers.\\nThe clickety-clack of our dress shoes echoed on the empty street like Clydesdales in Central Park. We were about 20 minutes late when we finally sat down and handed the wine list.\\n\"Gentleman, you look thirsty,\" cooed Bryn, our server for the evening. \"This here is a 2007 Marie-Noelle Ledru Cuvee du Goulte Blanc de Noirs Grand Cru...compliments on the house. The flavor is fantastic, we just ordered a few cases for our collection and we hope you enjoy it.\"\\n\\nAccording to the wine list, it was priced at $26/glass.... +1 for service and the perfect way to defuse our agita. The simmering anger I felt for being late and violating the dress code immediately evaporated. Here was a simple gesture that began to turn things around.\\n\\nTaking a breath and settling into my stool, I noticed the restrained decor. No fancy linens and tablecloths here - we sat at an expansive U-shaped steel counter devoid of superfluous elements. Everything had a purpose, and the cleanliness of the pass was striking. Besides Caesar, there were 3 sous-chefs quietly plating multiple dishes. The epitome of organization, efficiency, and timing.\\n\\nWe began our gastronomic journey with 10 amuse bouches, mostly pesce crudo. Fluke with daikon, turbot, portuguese sardines with leek and fired potato. These dishes were playful and contained elements of yuzu and other citrus nestled within the creamy layers of cilantro purée and pea purée. Sammy and I agreed that the acidity and tartness overpowered a few of these beginning dishes but the flavors were still unique and delicious.\\n\\nRead the rest of the entry here: www.scrumphsus.com/blog/2013/8/12/the-only-chefs-table-that-matters\\n',\n",

My dining partner made a good point \"the only rule for wine pairing should be - my glass should never be empty.\"  Paid $150 for wine pairing and accumulated was less than 4 full glasses.  My glass was empty 50% of the time with just sipping (not pounding).\\n',\n",

       " \"Gosh, where does one start when reviewing a three Michelin star establishment.  First off you have to have some perspective.  If the food isn't getting you excited then Bib's inspectors had an off day when they were selecting the restaurants.  If the service isn't  beyond compare then please see my previous comment.\\n\\nChef's Table at Brooklyn Fare is tiny, it seats eighteen around a bar and all of the food is cooked and assembled right in front of you.  The first thing to note is the theatre of the experience, Chef Ramirez works tirelessly, quietly and with maximum efficiency and splits the dining room into two groups of nine.  We sat at the later of the two sittings and was able to get a magical preview of the dishes to come as we watched the other half of the restaurant progress through the menu.\\n\\nThe food is, as you might imagine superb.  There is a distinctly Japanese feel to the menu which is fine by me as I credit them with some of the finest cuisine that the world has to offer.  The courses start off very light with a smattering of the highest quality raw fish available.  These dishes were delightful, from the oyster served under a dome with applewood smoke to the delicate slice of Japanese Trumpetfish but the best was yet to come (although my dining companion thought the latter dish was the best).\\n\\nI've been a big fan of Uni but find the quality can be so variable and there's nothing quite as bad as sea urchin that's past its prime.  So imagine my delight when I saw a wooden box inscribed with Hiragana come out as chef plated up these immaculate plates of brioche, Hokkaido (the food capital of Japan IMO) Uni and black truffle.  Immediately that dish became one of the top 5 foodstuffs I have ever tasted and I will take that experience to the grave with me.  \\n\\nThen things got really exciting with dish after dish of immaculately prepared produce of the 1%.  #occupymystomach please!  Highlights include the Japanese rice dish (don't call it a risotto!) with frankly ridiculous amounts of white truffle, a grade of Wagyu that chef informs me was even higher than Kobe and the multiple desserts.  I've noticed over the years how a lot of high end restaurants make a point of producing a dessert with milk chocolate in it and here was no exception.  The final dish of milk chocolate mousse with toasted cereal and barley ice cream was nothing short of awe inspiring.\\n\\nThe service was impressive.  Polite and friendly, incredibly well stage managed and never obtrustive.  They would layer the plates with silpat as they cleared the dishes to avoid the clinking of plates.  Special props go to the sommelier as she was incredibly knowledgeable and served up a six phased wine pairing that went *perfectly* with each dish.  I discovered that if you emptied your glass you got a top up too without a bat of an eyelid, perfect for a dipsomaniac like me.\\n\\nWe got the opportunity to chat to Chef Ramirez a little and the food nerd in me got very excited.  He was impressed that I knew he made his ice cream in a Pacojet and I got to look at his awesome smoking gun.  \\n\\nSo on balance the meal was so close to perfection, as it should be, but I feel it earned every one of it's five stars.  As the Michelin guide states a three star restaurant should be worth a special trip, which I made from California.  I was not disappointed and would go back whenever my finances allow it.\\n\",\n",

Fortunately, that was not the case. While the service isn't as all-out as it is at, say, Daniel or Eleven Madison, that is due to the small staff, not any particular attitude. I thought the service was polished and warm. Cesar, the chef, spoke with all of the guests and was very hospitable.  \\n\\nAs for the food, my wife and I agreed that every single dish except one was mind-blowing. That one dish was still very good, don't get me wrong, but we had 13 courses that each could be considered one of the best things we've ever eaten.\\n\\nThe restaurant is very expensive, but I feel it is still a great value when you compare it to what you get at Per Se (which has supplements) or any other competitors.

So yes, I felt the price quite painfully and it was no easy feat to do but still well worth it. \\n\\nYes, reservations where a pain but it only took a month or so of Mondays trying. A simple outlook calendar reminder worked fine.\\n\\nWhile some may expect a lot of frill and decadence to go with the dining experience at a Michelin rated place such as this, the food is only what matters to me. For what it's worth, Chef Ramirez won me over by being incredibly focused on the meal service as well as taking the occasional aside to interact and genuinely thank us for the company.\\n\\nIt's hard to remember all of the courses and there's really no point to describe them. Many of them I had never tasted or had never had prepared as such or even have had many times before but the flavors were all unique and distinct like it was my first bite of a new food altogether.\\n\\nWe received excellent advice on a few bottles of wine we paired with the dinner as well, which were nice additions to the meal.\\n\\nMy only criticism was perhaps our dining companions that evening, who spent most of their night on their phones or talking loudly. It's a shame you're so susceptible to other's behavior in the intimate atmosphere, but nothing can truly detract from the tasteful experience you'll inevitably enjoy. If you're expecting to be waited on hand and foot and be wooed by the chef, look elsewhere. If you value attention to detail, a gorgeous kitchen, fantastic food, and a respectful staff that has a routine down closer to a choreographed ballet sequence than the bustle of a normal wait staff, then you owe it to yourself to try it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I had the worst dining experience of my life here. My mom and aunt, both visiting all the way from Greece and my husband (on the very night of this 35th birthday) were all refused entry at the restaurant, very rudely, because one of us was wearing fancy, dressy shorts. We ended up having to go back and change, and then going in very late but we were humiliated in front of other guests and it ruined our night completely. Note that even though they were kicking us out they were also refusing to refund our money, which is why we ended up returning (impulse decision, which was wrong as the experience sucked). Also note that we all took the outmost care to dress nicely for a birthday dinner, its just that this chefs notion of what fancy is stuck in the 80s. Saddest and most disgraceful dining experience of my life. I am SURE the stories about the chef being abusive to his staff and diners are true. Stay away, the place is disgusting.\\n\\nAnd a note about the food -- the food is not original at all. There are a number of Japanese restaurants in New York that use similar, and often much more inventive, techniques. Shigure is one of my favorites. Just because he throws a spoonful of caviar on half the appetizers he is not creating culinary genius. In fact, substituting true originality with simply expensive ingredients is trashy.

There are chopsticks in the setting! Not only that, he is one of the nicest Chefs I have ever met. He is not one of those Chefs on their high horses. We even saw him bring the dishes to the back a few times. I really doubt someone who trained in Japan is going to be racist against Asians. Anyhow, on to the experience and food.\\n\\nChefs Table at Brooklyn Fare is a small intimate restaurant. It has 18 seats around a server in front of the kitchen. The staff was very polite and knowledgeable.  Luckily we were sat on the end so we got to have a few conversations with Chef Ramirez.  My wife and I split a 6 flight wine pairing along with our 18 course meal, she doesn't drink much. The pairings were excellent!  Although I'm not big on whites but these pairings were excellent with the seafood.  All of the dishes were amazing.  If you don't like Japanese food or seafood then you might want to try a different 3 star restaurant.  Personally, I have never had a tasting where I enjoyed every single dish this much.  The most memorable dishes were the golden eye snapper and uni brioche.  There were only two meat courses, wagyu and duck, both cooked to perfection.  All of the ingredients were excellent, no extra salt or sauce to hide any flavors.  Everything was refined and highlighted the proteins and ingredients.  The desserts were light and flavorful, very refreshing.  I did not leave feeling too full like Per Se's tasting, it was just the right amount of food.  The overall experience was perfect.  The staff even put sheets between the plates to minimize noise.  This was one of the best meals I've had in my life!  I would give it 6 stars if I could.\\n\\nReading some of the negative reviews on here reminds me why I think most of our population is dumb.  Half of the complaints were about not having enough conversation, the setting, restaurant policies, no pictures, difficult reservations, etc.  The restaurant emails you their policy, if you don't like them then go somewhere else.  It is that simple.  I don't want to sit next to someone dressed like a slob or next to someone snapping away with a DSLR in such an intimate setting.  For all the people complaining that the Chef didn't talk to them much, you come to a restaurant to eat, not talk to the Chef the whole time.  Does Thomas Keller come out and talk to you at Per Se or French Laundry?  He probably is never there. So what if he talked to others more than you?  You are probably boring and look like an arrogant person.  Enjoy your meal and talk to the company you brought. I bet if it were the reverse and the staff and Chef conversed too much people would complain too. I haven't written a review this long in awhile, but I had such an amazing experience and was annoyed reading all the idiotic negative reviews, I had to.  I feel bad that such a genius Chef has to deal with all these moronic reviewers on Yelp.\\n\",\n",

After not being able to book a reservation for Valentine\\'s Day, I was pleasantly surprised with a reservation on my birthday.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried many of the \"hot\" restaurants in NYC and had very high expectations for this one, since many places rated it as the best tasting restaurant in 2014.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nThis restaurant is extremely professional. If you have an early reservation, be prepared for an eerie silence before people get some alcohol in their system. The chefs make it a point to be very quiet throughout their food preparation process. Even the process of laying parts on the stainless steel counters was well considered... no banging of plates. When people start getting wine in their system, the tranquility disappears; the area is quite small and the noise bounces off of all surfaces. You will get plenty of professional smiles, but apart from the executive chef, do not expect much conversation warmness from the rest of the staff. Very professional though, as you would expect from any high class restaurant. The decor (if you want to call it that) is very simple and modern. It good very well with the rest of the restaurant.\\n\\nService:\\nProfessional and attentive would be the best way to describe the service. As mentioned before, the service is very professional. More importantly, it is very attentive. Many places don\\'t fill your water glasses quick enough, leaving you thirsty with an empty cup. Not here; you get as much water as your little heart desires.\\n\\nFood:\\nThe moment you\\'ve all been waiting for... my opinion on the food! Anyway, was it all I hoped and dreamed for? Probably not. I had unreachable expectations of perfection that this certainly was not. The food was absolutely amazing though. Presentation deserved an A+. There was much attention placed on the small details. The fusion of tastes and flavors blended very well. Some of the food was slightly over-salted, but that was the only flaw from perfection.\\n\\nOverall, I would have to say that this is a must try for anyone who feels that food is an art form.\\n',\n",
       " \"The best meal in quality, presentation and precision I've ever eaten. The fact that you are at the chefs table adds another level of enjoyment. Well worth the price point given the experience.\\nChef Ramirez is extraordinary!\\n\",\n",
       " \"I believe that the location for this venue is going to be changing and that they are moving from Brooklyn to Manhattan. The location is unique, I like that it's in an area of Brooklyn you wouldn't expect. I loved the intimacy of this restaurant, I loved watching the chefs prepare food as we sat around. It really is unusual and very fun! The food was perfect. Absolutely delightful! I loved getting to know our fellow dining companions. You sit around a large chefs table (hence the name) and so sit next to others and over the course of a few hours of dining and drinking you do get to know them as you comment on the deliciousness of the food.\\n\",\n",
       " \"FOOD POISONING!!!!!!\\n\\nMy dinner companions and I got very sick from the food at this restaurant.  The owner Moe did not take care of us after the fact.  After paying $1100 for 4 people, not including wine, we were very disappointed to say the least.  We thought the chef 's plates and ideas were great.  The service were outstanding.  Something was served to us that made us sick and the owner refused to acknowledge that the food was the cause.\\nNot acceptable.\\n\\nNever going back to this restaurant.\\n \\n0 stars\\n\",\n",
       " \"Excellent dining experience, as others have noted before. Certainly the most laid back and approachable 3M* you're likely to visit in NYC, or anyplace, for that matter. Highlights of our meal included a plop of uni wrapped in a white truffle shaving, and a white truffle ice cream. Decadent dining, I had a stomach ache, but it was worth it. I would return for another special occasion in the future, and would tell others to try CT @ BF.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Food will never be the same again.  Its been a week since I ate here and just about everything that has passed my lips since the Chef's Table has tasted terrible. I'm ruined and still in a mourning period.\\n\\nThis was the best meal I've ever had. Every one of the 20+ dishes were fabulous and 4 or 5 were at the top of the ohmygodnothingcouldtasteasgoodasthisitsimpossible league .  The place is a sort of high church of food: it is difficult to think about anything other than the food.... indeed its difficult to have a conversation while you watch the team in the kitchen silently and precisely create one plate after another, and noiselessy collect each course.   If Per Se is the Rolls Royce of NY dining, then Chef's Table is the Formula 1 machine.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The food was of course excellence which is to be expected at this level. Relative to other three-star places, I've got mixed feelings - I feel like it's a must-visit if dining at this level isn't alien to you, but might not be my first pick for others.\\n\\nI really (really) loved that Chef Ramirez was present in the kitchen, and went around exchanging a few words with everyone.\\n\\nI see the reasoning behind anachronous dress codes, but it's aggravating when they're prissy about guys dressing formally to the point of asking you to put your jacket back on when you're overheating; all while the females are free to wear pretty much anything they like (even if it's not as extreme as I've experienced elsewhere.)\\n\",\n",
       " \"Cannot describe in words how perfect this place is. Just go. I can't wait to go back. I have been to numerous michelin starred restaurants, including Le Bernardin, Jea Georges, Per Se, Masa, Bouley, Marea, etc, but this one is the very best. Hands down.\\n\",\n",

       " \"I went to this place with my hubby and friends like half years ago. I had a bad feeling as we walked in. We were seated in the center, and yes we are Asian, but I never thought because of that we got the seats far away from the Chef Ramirez. As we started to eat, he went to all the guests and chitchated a bit. BUT he skipped us, we were wondering why he did that. My instinct was telling my that maybe he doesn't like Asian? But then I thought maybe I was too sensitive. Maybe we were talking to each other and he didn't want to disturb. After we finished the meal, he didn't say thank you or what so ever as we walked out the door. \\nToday I saw the news saying they are racist, it confirmed my instinct. That was our first time there, and we decided never go back to that place again. And I was keep telling my friends about my bad experience. Food quality is good, only because they are imported directed from Japan. Desserts are huge disappointment. I tired almost the three starts Michelin restaurants in NYC. I had the worse experience in this restaurant because I was wondering why he talked to everyone but us. I was really uncomfortable there.  With that kind of money I spent, I expected outstanding service.  Not discriminated. Chef Ramirez, if you don't like Asians, we can just simply skip this place. There are so many good restaurants to go in NYC.\\n\",\n",
       " \"its probably not worth selling your car to go to dinner at brooklyn fare, unless you have two cars anyway.  also, they don't offer financing at brooklyn fare.\\n\\nyes, its pricey, and it doesn't have the underground cache it did when it opened as a byob at just over $100 /plate.\\n\\nall that out of the way, my meal last week at brooklyn fare was hands down the best of my life.  each of the 25 or so courses is something new, without being a gimmick.  the menu is seafood heavy, with several raw fish dishes.\\n\\nEDIT: I wrote this in 2012 but somehow failed to post.  But the conclusions stand.  Also, I've since sold one of my cars and spent the proceeds on food.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Great food but my overall experience was tainted by Chef Ramirez\\'s treatment of his guests. During my dinner experience here, there was an encounter where the chef started yelling at one of the guests. \\n\\nHe specifically stated, \"THIS IS MY HOUSE AND THESE ARE MY RULES!\"\\n\\nIt created a very awkward dining experience and I did not appreciate his tone or treatment of his customers. I would not be happy paying a premium to get yelled at.\\n',\n",
       " \"Finally was able to get a reservation and it was worth the effort. It was fantastic. We had the six wine pairing and they were all well laid out for the menu.\\n\\nFrom the canapé's to the final meat course - everything was perfect. Not much to add to what's been said in previous reviews.\\n\\nOn a side note, I can now say that I've been to all the Michelin 3 stars in NYC. I guess I'll start at the beginning again\\n\",\n",
       " \"My trip started with a sour note. Food was average, for the price you pay there are better options, but this is not where my gripe is at. I've had one of the worst service I can possibly have. Some staff was friendly and helpful while 2 was extremely extremely rude. My group was well dressed slacks, dressshirt and tie. We were not treated fairly infact one of them ignored us for the entire night while giving other guest their full attention. Even after I flagged one of them he would turn to another guest and ask the other guest if he needed anything as if he was trying to make an excuse to ignore me. I will keep my opinions reserved on here but it did look like some group of guest were treated better than others. On top of that they add 20% on top of my tab. I will not come back.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I called for 45 minutes to get a reservation and took one of my favorite clients. When I asked if we could sit closest to the chef, we were first told it was reserved - until Chef Ramirez waved us forward. \\n\\nThis food is as good as it gets. From the cucumber sorbet that started the evening, to the mussel with granny smith apple jelly and horseradish sauce, to the langoustines, to the butterfish, to the wagyu beef, every ingredient this chef uses is top of the line. Do not go here if you are afraid of unique flavor combinations or ingredients. It is insulting to the chef and service if you won't at least taste all of what he creates. An undeveloped palate might not be worth spending this kind of money to feed, so if your girlfriend gets freaked out by aioli, don't bother. \\n\\nOne tip - I probably could have just done the 4 wine pairing instead of the 6 and been able to drink slower. The wine kept catching up to the food.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Arrogant? Yes! Awkward? Yes! A prick? Likely. Racist? Unlikely. \\n\\nMy husband (Caucasian) and I (Asian) had the immense pleasure of dining at Chef\\'s Table years ago. In light of the terrible backlash Chef Ramirez has been receiving ( primarily from people who\\'ve had no first-hand experience with the Chef or his restaurant), I\\'d like to add a more informed opinion. I\\'d like to make several factual points:\\n\\n1) There was no apparent difference in cuts between what I was served versus what my husband was served. (Maybe he was a \"suspected Upper West Sider\"...can someone please explain what that even means?!?)\\n2) The people seated closest to the Chef were in fact Asian women. And he was very friendly to them - even taking photos with them. Actually, my recollection was he was friendly ONLY to them! (FYI, the people seated furthest away from the Chef were not Asian. My point being, I don\\'t think there was specific instruction either way.)\\n3) Several of the Chef\\'s staff (servers and sous chefs) were Asian. Why hire them if you don\\'t like them?\\n4) Months after dining at Chef\\'s Table, I spotted the Chef at Casa Mono and his companion was (drumroll please...) Asian! (Strange he would choose to spend his free time with a person he allegedly considers \"shit\". But let\\'s face it, some of us Asians are \"shit\" and if I was a 3-starred Chef, I wouldn\\'t want them seated near me either, thus avoiding annoying questions, commentary, and conversation as I\\'m trying to work my culinary magic.)\\n\\nSo let\\'s not believe accusations are fact or smear someone without hearing all sides.\\n\\nNow, onto the purpose of Yelp and Yelp reviews... My husband and I thought our meal was excellent - one of the best of our lives. And we would gladly experience it again. Bad cuts? Give us more! They were delicious!\\n\\nAnd now my message to Yelp, please delete any and all reviews from anyone who has never dined at Chef\\'s Table. It\\'s unfair to a business to be smeared based on unproven accusations by reviewers with no first-hand experience. And threatening messages to the Chef are irresponsible and classless. There\\'s no value to anyone reading that.\\n',\n",
       " \"If I could give zero stars I would.   Went here a few months ago and was excited to get the food.   Went with gf and we were literally the only people the chef didn't say hi to.  Of course we were the only asians there.  He walked by us at least half a dozen times to get something from the back and nothing.  Sitting beside us was a couple from Mexico city and he spent the entire time talking to them.  When he passed by us I said I enjoy the food and he completely ignored me.  Food is good but not worth the racism.\\n\",\n",
       " \"First off, to get a reservation you have to repeatedly call several weeks in advance. I think I called for about an hour and successfully got a reservation for 2.\\n\\nThe meal, service, wine were all impeccable. Our group got split into 2 so we saw what we would be eating about 20 minutes before we got to eat it (that was tantalizing). It was really fun to watch all the chefs prepare, cook, and plate each dish! I think watching the plating was the most fun. The servers were very attentive and placed papers between each plate so that when we got our new plates, there was no sound. Another cool aspect of Chef's Table is most dishes were very creative and would not be found on a typical menu..one dessert was a globe of chocolate and the servers would pour more chocolate on it which made it melt in a beautiful and delicious way. Even though there were 20+ plates, each plate was pretty small so we had no trouble finishing every last bite. Chef Ramirez did not greet us, say goodbye, or even look at us once. Oh, there was a Jets football player at the other end of the table which was cool..\\n\\n4 stars instead of 5 because of the insane price and because the chef is apparently racist against Asians (despite many of his starters being sushi). I went last August but if I had heard the racist allegations before then, I would not have come. When there's smoke, there fire.\\n\",\n",
       " \"It was even better than expected!  Actually, I think it was even better than Per Se, if that's possible.  They use the freshest ingredients like seafood from Tsukiji market!.  What I enjoyed the most was the Chawanmushi with foie gras and crab and shiso sorbet, even though everything was yummy.  Oh, the Wagyu with daikon/horseradish was superb b/c nothing can match like grated daikon with full bodied beef!  It's a bit expensive but it was worth it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'THIS is what a real meal tastes like. I have never fallen in love with flavors like this before. It was love at first bite. From the fish flown in from Japan, to the sea urchin and wine to cleanse our palate - we did it right! This meal is well worth it. GO!\\n',\n",
       " 'I have to give this restaurant five stars, because it certainly deserves all five! We visited this past weekend and had a wonderful dining experience.\\n\\nI am usually not a fan of dinners with a large number of courses because I get bored easily, but the dinner went by so quickly I was sad it was over. There is nothing pretentious about this place- no long waits between courses, no white table cloths, approachable and friendly wine list, etc. Everything was just perfect. \\n\\nThe only thing I must mention is the price. I am not saying that the price is unfair or not warranted, but just know that it is expensive. We had four adults and with wine (1 bottle of champagne, 1 bottle of white, and 2 bottles of red) we spent over $2,000 and our wines were all under $150/bottle. But it it worth it and the sommelier was fantastic - though I cannot remember her name. \\n\\nThe \"no cell phone\" policy is amazing! People are talking, engaging, enjoying and appreciate each dish without trying to capture every moment on their camera. \\n\\nI was told they are moving to Manhattan and growing a bit larger. Hope that it does not take away from the charm of this great gem!\\n',\n",

It was also the best experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Yes I'm not a rich man and it cost me $700+ for 2 people but with that combination plus the fact it was for a special occasion made it worth it.\\n\\nI can sit here and give you the whole megillah but as others have also mentioned I can't do it any justice.  I will list the highlights.\\n\\n- Such an intimate setting.  Just 18 guests who are all as eager as you sitting around a semicircle table watching the kitchen prepare all the meals.  It's always amazing seeing professionals do their thing whether its artists or athletes.  This time it was chefs.\\n- The chef Cesar is such a humble, cool guy.  The whole staff for that matter.  I chatted with most of them throughout the night.  They really made the night feel special.\\n- 20+ tasting course of just amazing fresh seafood.  I am not a foodie and I don't pretend to be so I can't tell you what they did to make everything so excellent but they served dishes I've never seen before.  For me that was the best, tasting things I never have before and might never taste again.\\n- Desert and wine were just as amazing.\\n\\nI anxiously awaited eating here for the entire 6 weeks since I was able to make a reservation.  The night exceeded expectations and then some.  If you can do it make the call and hopefully you can get a reservation.\\n\",\n",

I actually remember most of the plates in this gastronomic symphony, but stand outs were:\\nHeart of palm - succulent, melt in your mouth.\\nMackerel - just cooked to perfection (possibly cooked japanese style, slowly over bincho) then finished off on the grill.\\nUni with black truffle on crostini - probably the best single bite. I see why chef Ramirez doesn't want pictures: if this were eaten even seconds after it's served, it just wouldn't be as perfect.\\nThe lobster - three immaculate bites of lobster with amazing herbs to accompany.\\nThe matcha dessert - pure magic how it melts in your mouth while instilling the taste.\\nSeriously, this was probably my second best meal in Manhattan, and one of the best in my life. Totally worth the price and trouble of getting the reservation. I'll have to see if they can do a sake pairing as the wine pairing doesn't seem to work with the style of seafood served.\\n\",\n",

The place has 3 Michelin stars so obviously the food is great.\\n\\nI made a reservation for 4 people through Amex concierge. They precharged my cc 4 x $255 before tax, tip and drinks. The only restaurant rule I was told was that jackets were required for men. We arrived a few minutes early, pulled on the glass door and it was locked. Note, the staff and other patrons were a foot away from the door. Staff members were walking by the door as I was trying to open it and avoided eye contact, very weird. So we waited and eventually someone unlocked the door and told us to come in as if nothing had happened. We sit down and start watching the kitchen staff do their thing.. PERFECTLY hanging copper pots from the kitchen's ceiling, laying out plates (painstakingly slow), it was over the top, you get the point. The staff never really spoke over a whisper, made no noise, the chef never introduced himself or made eye contact, I really thought I was being punished for something. Eventually, after a few bottles of wine, my group made the best of it and ignored the weird environment. Another annoying thing was that you weren't allowed to take pictures or take notes. If I'm paying $1700 for dinner I expect to be able to save the memory with a picture.\\n\\nOut of The French Laundry, 11 Madison Park, and Joel Robuchan, Chef's Table was by far my least memorable, and most pretentious, 3 Michelin star experience.\\n\\nI would not return.\\n\",\n",
       " \"NOT WORTH IT!!  The nutshell version: $1,000 for sushi and 2 glasses of wine.\\n\\nFood: Its $570 before you walk in ($225 pp + tax and 20% gratuity) You do not get a menu and G-d forbid you make a note or try to use your phone to take a photo. It was 27 bites with the first 18 being raw fish. The 18 bites were actually great but the rest of the meal was only ok.\\n\\nWine: The wine pairing was $150 for 6 glasses pp and the pours were 2oz- they were tasting pours not real pours. This was probably the biggest rip-off. If you go, and I suggest you don't, buy a bottle of the Vouvray.\\n\\nService: HORRIBLE! I could have lived with the $$$ price tag had the attitude been better. It was not just unprofessional but outright rude. And not just a little, but shockingly rude. Could this be why they get their tip ahead of time? \\n\\nAtmosphere: You are in a kitchen, on a stool at a mental counter (in a dicey neighborhood to boot). I wouldn't have minded so much as I have done chef tables before, but usually the chefs will talk to you and tell you what they are doing which makes for an intimate and instructional experience. Apparently this chef forbids talking so the the chefs have their backs to you and don't make a sound.\\n\\nI paid $1,000 to indulge this chef's inflated ego, follow his silly rules, get treated like crap and walk out cold sober. \\n\\nFor the exact same amount, go to Per Se which has an unparrelled menu, gorgeous view and atmosphere, amazing service and hospitality.

But now that I have had this experience. I will not be spending my 300$ anywhere else in other restaurants.\\n\\n- Minimalist - Quiet quaint intimate KITCHEN setting with 1 server in the middle and two others for wine and utensils. You feel like you are eating in the chef\\'s kitchen in his home, instead of being in a luxury classy-ass restaurant where you feel 5 servers staring at you. I hate being watched while I eat. And Chef\\'s table made me feel, well, at home, and comfortable.\\n\\n- One bite - This concept rocks. In some restaurants you get a giant piece of art where you don\\'t know where to start. Whether you have to pile all 15 elements of the plate together in one spoon and look like a fool. Or just having too much of something mediocre, and also on the flip side having too much of something really strong tasting and ruin the rest of the meal for you. ONE BITE. NO THOUGHTS. In your mouth. Enjoy. Before you know it, something else is coming up\\n\\n- Live action - It\\'s like being on an Iron chef show. You observe the movements of the chef and the other cooks. You see how they all know what to do immediately and no one is ever standing around doing nothing. A well rehearsed show in action, where everything is done to the finest. Where every cook gets the chance to be in the limelight of being in the middle of the kitchen table. Teamwork. Cohesiveness. No ego, no showing off, none of that \"YES CHEF! RIGHT AWAY CHEF!\" attitude. Just skill and pure concentration, dedication. You feed off that energy as you eat the food they so carefully prepared. No other restaurant can give you that experience.\\n\\n- Courses - counted about 27 courses carefully made and I enjoyed EVERY SINGLE FUCKING ONE of it. Ever tried a tasting menu where you feel \"EH. That second, fourth, sixth course? I didn\\'t really care for them\" YOU DON\\'T GET THAT HERE. No one dish is shy of another. Every single one of them planned to prepare you for the next, and the taste JUST KEEPS getting BETTER. \\n\\n- Chef - Love his personality. Love his attitude. The way he is humbly teaching his cooks as he makes the food, giving them instructions in a subtle and not demanding way. Treating everyone with respect. My boyfriend and I were  lucky enough to sit at the edge of the kitchen table where he spoke to us quite often and even hand-served my food and told me what it was. He even talked about how difficult his hours were (9AM in the morning to 2AM At night) but said how he managed to stay GROUNDED by loving what he does, and even acknowledging how hard his crew works. He doesn\\'t care for luxury, but serving the BEST food he can find. Knowing him on a personal level, makes the eating experience even better - as now the food tells a story about his life, and what it took for all those plates to make the table. \\n\\nHe is ALWAYS in the kitchen, and he said that if he weren\\'t, the restaurant would not open. This coming from a 3 Michelin star restaurant chef - this is what sets him apart from others. \\n\\nAt the end of the night when my boyfriend and I left, he even opened the door himself and I shook his hand thanking him for the wonderful meal, and that I will be back. And I fucking mean it. \\n\\nThank you Chef Ramirez, the entire crew, the wonderful servers for this experience. This meal really touched my heart - and I will be calling every fucking second at 10.30am on Monday to get another reservation for my birthday.\\n',\n",

The thought process and the execution of each plate is beyond words. From the uni truffle on brioche to the sturgeon and potato topped with caviar all the way to the dessert at the end, each bite just kept getting better and better. No pictures were taken during the meal, out of respect for the chef. It was an other worldly experience. I highly recommend the wine pairing as the sommelier who assisted us was highly knowledgeable.\\n\\nI don't understand how those racist allegations came up, but Chef Ramirez was so kind and engaging in discussing his experiences and technique for each dish.

Nobody of sane mind would question, argue or debate the intense quality, taste and presentation of the food served here. I can't remember finding one review that said otherwise. So my review will not focus on what should be uncontested, the amazing food experience you are sure to have! Instead I want to focus on what many people did have issues with: the sommelier, server, and more frequently. the chef himself. I am happy to say, those issues are being contested!\\n\\nI was lucky enough to score a gift certificate to eat here from a very dear friend as a wedding present. What a great wedding present right? So prior to going I did a lot of homework: reading the last year's worth of reviews from Fodders, TripAdvisor, and here; not to mention many critics' reviews. A common thread emerged from the many of the reviews, the service! Stuffy, cold or rude wait staff, no explanation of the dishes, no photos allowed, and then there's the chef. Whether he was unfriendly, didn't like playing host, didn't engage with the patrons even though this IS the 'Chef's Table', or just being mean: there were many people saying the same thing. I even recall reading two separate reviews where as patrons were leaving, the chef stood there at the door not saying a thing and presumably waiting for them to thank HIM. So I was pretty worked up on the way there, running through my head that if I witnessed any of this, I was going to address it. After all there was no way I was going to let a wonderful wedding present like this be tainted by a diva chef that can't get out of his own way. \\n\\nBut just the opposite happened! The sommelier was a pleasure, and when I told him my plan of starting with Champagne, them move on to white and then to end with red, he gave timing of when to make the transition and offered suggestions along the way. He was overly friendly and sweet! The server was just great! I cannot see anyone having a problem with her! She explained every dish, even though we were almost last in the line, was friendly, and actually really personable. We were chatting her up throughout the meal, and instead of being short and just giving half-friendly smiles, she engaged in conversation with us. She really added to our dining experience! \\n\\nAnd then there is Caesar. He made sure to say hello to everyone, my husband and I separately in fact, and it was one of those hand on the shoulder warm hellos too. Now granted, he actually ended up having a full on conversation with every couple there but us. I didn't hold that against him though because my husband and I were in full on conversation the majority of the meal and enjoying ourselves. I didn't feel the need to have a conversation with him just for the sake of it. However, watching him work the room was nice to see! Now don't get me wrong, I would probably tend to agree with the people who say we should lower our expectations of chefs, and that they usually aren't the best playing 'host'. We want them to cook well, and Chef certainly does! But even if he wasn't 100% into it, he played the game, and I thought pretty well.\\n\\nAll in all, all of the complaints made of this place I think have been for the most part, resolved. However, I have come up with some different ones: First, where we were sitting, we were listening to the dishwasher the entire evening. I get it that they have to clean the dishes, and being we were the last seating they probably didn't want to be there all night after we left. But I have to say it was distracting! They will be renovating the space soon, please take care of this! Also, there was sorbet and three dessert courses, all of them being ice cream. I was looking for some cake or pastry of some sort, so the all-ice cream thing was a surprise. I was also surprised that there was no cheese course. I normally don't look forward to these courses, but for whatever reason this time I was. \\n\\nSmall things to complain about in an otherwise amazing dinner! The first four sashimi courses and the wagyu beef was the most amazing thing I ate all night. All in all, don't let the previous negative reviews prevent you from experiencing a meal everyone needs to have at least once! Maybe twice if you are lucky!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Have been meaning to try this place forever, but could never get a reservation. Finally, I got one. After calling and calling and calling on a Monday at 10:30, my call was answered at around 10:39 and I was put on hold. Three times thereafter someone picked up and I mentioned that I was on hold for a reservation - this made me anxious that they would hang up on me. Finally got through to the reservationist, who took our reservation for a Saturday at 7:45 pm. Prime time. Process and billing was explained, email and credit card taken, and done. Awesome.I figured at 10:39 I wouldn't get a weekend spot. But I did. Don't despair!\\n\\nApproximately 2 weeks later I received a confirmation email, and then another one maybe three weeks later as a reminder / last chance to cancel. \\n\\nNight of, we left with plenty of time, but a sick passenger on the train disrupted our plans, and we ended up arriving about 10 minutes late. THANK GOD our seats were still there and we didn't miss any of the courses. The table is in the shape of a wide horseshoe with a server / plater in the middle and the chef + 3 assistants behind the grill. We really liked to watch them making the dishes and guessing whether they would be served to our half of the table or the other half (servings are slightly staggered). We were seated on the end of the table, right up next to the kitchen, and the chef came over and made lots of pleasantries. We aren't the type to gush over food, just enjoy eating good food, so we didn't really have much to chat about. \\n\\nThe food itself was great. Not huge fish eaters, but the one-bite concept was perfect. Loved everything except the sea urchin dishes - just not my thing. Dessert was phenomenal. By the time it rolled around though, we were STUFFED and could barely eat anymore. We still did though.\\n\\nAll in all, this place was great. For the price it's more of a one-time thing, but a great experience with really great food.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Very interesting meal here....\\n\\nThis is one of the most unique and innovative dining experiences I've ever had. The dishes are ultra modern with a heavy focus on fish and seafood. The truffle uni dish was to die for! The service is very coordinated down to the tee but i admit it did feel a bit cold and robotic. I appreciate that Chef Ramirez tried to make conversation with the people around the table but even he seemed cold. Alas, the delicious food and ultra difficult to get reservations gets this meal five stars.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I am so, so conflicted about this one. The food was out-of-this-world amazing, but the service fell short. I was expecting way more, service-wise, from a restaurant with 3 Michelin Stars.\\n\\nPre-dinner:\\n\\nI can\\'t comment on the reservation process, since the American Express concierge service took care of that. We got a 9:30pm seating, which is much later than I usually eat dinner, but we were happy to get a reservation at all.\\n\\nYou are told to arrive on time, or else you may miss courses. Punctuality is important. I get that. But what happens when you show up 15 minutes early (which, in my book, is on time!)? There is no waiting area. You either have to linger around awkwardly outside (or in the little weather vestibule thing) or find something to do for 15 minutes. I saw no bars or coffee shops or anything other than a parking garage in the immediate area, so I stood outside like a creeper. It was really strange and did not give me good feelings about dinner.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nTo my relief, after we received our first course, all my judgments were erased. The food was on a completely different level. Every little bite was so complex and so elevated. It was course after course of sheer delight; we were disappointed when our first dessert course came because that was the signal it was almost over. When it comes to the food, believe the hype.\\n\\n(I just wish they could have given me a copy of their menu so I could remember what we ate! It\\'s a little thing that would have made the experience that much better. And a signed menu would have been even more special.)\\n\\nService:\\n\\nUnfortunately, the service fell short of my expectations. It was by no means BAD, but it was not the flawless execution I expected with a $255+ meal.\\n\\nFor starters, my water and wine glasses should have never been empty (well, until the wine was done). I was disappointed that I had to wait for both my water and wine to be refilled, more than once.\\n\\nI also found the presentation of each dish to be rather terse. The description of each course was \"Something with something.\" That was it. Nothing else. The server was almost too polished and too professional, if that makes any sense. Oh, and I found it strange that the chefs did not serve one dish. What\\'s the point of sitting in the kitchen if there is zero interaction with those preparing your food? \\n\\nSpeaking of which, the kicker was our interaction with Chef Cesar himself. There was none. He made his way around the table, talking to most (if not all) of the other diners... except us. Fine, whatever, he\\'s busy in the kitchen and maybe he got sidetracked. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But at the end of the meal, we thanked him and very politely asked to get a picture with him, and we were told he doesn\\'t take pictures. I know that is a lie. I\\'ve seen photos of diners with him on Yelp and Instagram, and so did one of my dining companions (which is why we thought it was OK to ask). So, what the hell? It left a very poor taste -- figuratively -- in our mouths at the end of the meal. It made me feel like I was not welcome... and after our party dropped $1k+ on a meal, it was not a good feeling! I\\'ve read that he\\'s shy, but that\\'s not an excuse to treat us differently from his other guests. And if he\\'s shy and doesn\\'t like doing the whole \"front of the house\" thing, maybe his \"restaurant\" shouldn\\'t be in the kitchen. Just sayin\\'.\\n\\nTLDR: Food was AMAZING, but the rest of the experience was meh. The food brings the average way up to a 4... but I\\'m not sure I would return. I\\'d rather drop that same $$$$ at a place like EMP, Le Bernardin, etc., and be treated like a queen.\\n',\n",
       " \"Wow!  This was a wonderful dining experience.  Each course was perfectly prepared and the attention to detail was superb.  The service was top notch, along with near perfect wine pairings.  The only negative that I can come up with, was the lack of space.  If two seats were removed, it would make dining here a bit more comfortable.  This is a must stop for any foodie!  I can't wait to return...\\n\",\n",
       " 'Hard to believe any meal could be better than this one!\\n\\nChef Ramirez is a gifted man in deed. I think our favorite was the Uni with a black truffle - one perfect bite - but I could single out each course and sing its praises.\\n\\nMy husband even ate the vegetables. He never eats the veggies.\\nI think his favorite course was the Grade a5 Wagyu beef and its no surprise. Delicious!!\\n\\nWe thankfully got the paring and Laura did an excellent job that helped the elevate the meal (if further elevation is even possible...)\\n\\nGo. Cause you gotta know!!!\\n',\n",

       " \"My husband and I have had the good fortune of trying every 3 Michelin star rated restaurant in NY except Masa (for now ...) - and Brooklyn Fare is now my favorite (Eleven Madison is a close #2). My experience at Brooklyn Fare was excellent. The food was truly superb - each item was delightful and surprising, featuring a range of temperatures (hot/cold), textures (crunchy/soft)  and flavors - all of which serves the purpose of highlighting the freshness and flavors of the primary ingredient. The portion sizes are perfect - you will certainly be full at the end of the meal, but not so full that you'll be waddling out or bursting at the seams :) As well, I enjoyed Brooklyn Fare's relatively less formal and smaller + more intimate atmosphere; I love that the chefs are preparing each course right in front of you! I thought the service - particularly from the sommelier and from the chef himself - was wonderful. For reference: my husband and i were seated closest to the ovens - which we actually loved because these seats felt roomier (no one was seated to my right) and it meant we got to spend the most time chatting with the chef! I'm looking forward to the chef's next endeavor in NYC!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Get a reservation, save your money for 6 weeks, and eat at Chef's Table. You deserve it.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The food was uniformly excellent, but I kind of hate this place, at least a little.  I mean, a meal costs $225 per person, with 20% gratuity on top, charged before you walk in the door.  If you can't make it, you swallow the whole cost.  If you come late (we were late - sigh), you miss part of the meal.  All this is whatever, I guess.  Restaurants are allowed to charge as much as they can get away with, and I understand the stiff rules.  If you think of the three hour dinner here as a pre-paid show, you can even understand why you give up part of the entertainment on a late arrival.  But - all this should buy a handsome, thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Not so.\\n\\nThe reservation system is fucked up.  My mom called to inquire about booking a spot, and the guy on the phone told her to call back the coming Monday.  When she got through on that specified day (after over 400 attempts!), the same guy told her to call the next week - he had made a mistake.  Thankfully, he was able to find us a spot, but he gave my mom a hard enough time that she almost cried.\\n\\nAnd once we arrived, service was just not good.  It was competent and somewhat formal, but cold as ice.  I liked the setting - intimate, 18 counter seats with a full view of all the prep, with a waitress circling the middle - but it was so metallic and joyless, I felt like I was watching surgery.  I suspect the management heard that curt, clinical service is prestigious, that it shows that an expensive pre-paid meal is still a privilege.  Obviously, as an OCD Yelper, I'm going to complain about the no photo no notes policy.  Look, it's pretentious as hell, but I kind of get the no photos.  But no notes?  I tried anyway, just took notes on my phone under the table, thinking the purpose of the policy was to not bother other customers.  Nope.  Halfway through, one of the servers stopped me.  The policy is in place because Brooklyn Fare has some notion of keeping itself a (super prestigious) black box.  Well fuck that.  I derive a lot of my enjoyment from a meal in its lasting impression, and photos and menus add a lot of value to my dining.  $400+ should buy a detailed account.  So I found a loophole.  Let's just say it's my photographic memory.\\n\\nI gather we missed around four courses, and ate somewhere around twenty, with glasses of Sancerre and champagne and Burgundy along the way.  The food was delicious, heavy on seafood, with beautiful flavors and plating.  I had a few favorites.  The King salmon with trout roe, cilantro, and onion, was a top grade piece of fish, buttery and fresh, accented by the burst of roe and the clean green cilantro sauce.  San Diego sea urchin with black truffle and brioche exploded on my palate, a bite of ultimate luxury.  Octopus came cooked to a perfect yielding firmness, with hearts of palm and cucumber to augment its flavor and texture.  And finally, I loved a small bowl of smoked cod and potato topped with a heap of black caviar.\\n\\nThe rest of the dishes were less memorable, but never less than superb.  We started in time for a few fanciful morsels of premium sushi.  First there was jackfish with sunchoke, arugula, ginger, and sesame; then the King salmon; then hiramasa with golden trout roe, crispy burdock root, and a hit of mustard; then that lovely uni.  Next came Portuguese sardine with sage and a potato chip; after that a small bowl of jumbo lump crab with shredded phyllo, scallop, and cucumber yogurt.  The meal continued with the octopus and smoked cod, with a meaty piece of langoustine in between, coated in a fragrant Iranian saffron sauce.  A seafood custard brought flavors of truffle, dashi, shrimp, uni, chives, and black pepper, in a dish reminiscent of a chawanmushi.  The next two dishes brought larger fillets of fish - delicate red-scaled rouget with Japanese rice and Thai curry, and turbot with black truffle and sunchoke.  The rouget was perfectly cooked, but the rice wasn't great, and the curry a bit meek.  The turbot dish had a stronger profile, with flavors that bloomed.  The meal leaned away from seafood for its final movement, starting with a transitional plate bearing bites of lobster, veal agnolotti, abalone, and foie gras.  All good, none extraordinary.  Then there was tender duck with porcini mushroom and miso salsify, and to segue to dessert, sheep's milk cheese with pear, balsamic, and crouton.  I loved the intermezzo of blood orange and Greek yogurt sorbet.  For dessert, there was a spiced tonka bean ice cream with chocolate and gold, and finally vanilla cake with tangerine, granola, and Riesling ice cream.  The desserts were not the highlight, but they were certainly good.  Chocolate caramels sent us out the door.\\n\\nFor all the glorious food, I couldn't muster much love for this meal.  Sure, the food was essentially flawless, but best I've ever had?  A solid no.  I've had better meals, with great service, at enough restaurants, for less money, that I don't have to come back to Brooklyn Fare ever again.\\n\",\n",
       " \"One word - AMAZING!! Yes, calling for a reservation was a challenge, but for a place with 18 seats that's 3-star Michelin rates, it can't be helped. The food was incredible. You can literally taste the creativity and care in each bite. We did a bottle of wine, and then a glass of red that, and a dessert wine. We found that a great way to enjoy wine and get to try one or two extras. I won't go into the detail of each course - it should be a surprise!\\n\",\n",
       " \"So many courses, each unique and amazingly delicious!! Came here for my birthday dinner and on top of the wonderfully warm service, the room was intimate and inviting and everything I looked at was beautifully arranged and pristine. It was very cool to be able to see the work and precision that went into preparing each dish. Chef Ramirez was also very friendly and happily chatted with my foodie father about his dishes. Dishes ranged from raw fish to soup to steak and each was interesting and delicious. Great place to go for a special occasion as its definitely not your everyday dinner spot - but it's a once in a lifetime type of meal so if highly recommend it to anyone!\\n\",\n",
       " \"If I could give this 20 stars I would.  Chef Cesar Ramirez brings the freshness/general wonderfulness of eating seafood in Tokyo/Hokkaido to Brooklyn and it is amazing.  For starters, I had never had sea urchin so fresh in my life.  I actually thought that I didn't like abalone before, and ended up loving it at Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare.  It's also just plain  awesome how you get to sit so close and watch the food preparation/art - watching the chefs assemble some of the dishes is part art/part surgery.  Everything is creative, artistic and dainty-looking, and then tastes mind-blowingly amazing.  Between the freshness of the seafood and the creative combinations of the dishes and then their artistic appearance, each course brings new highs and delights.  Chatting with Chef Cesar is a bonus too!  It's rare that you basically get to sit in the kitchen of a restaurant, let alone a 3-Michelin star, top-notch restaurant.  I will never forget this birthday dinner for the rest of my life.  What an experience and what a meal.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Best meal in NYC and it's not even close.  I've been to every other Michelin 3 star in NYC (EMP, Per Se, Daniel, JG, Masa, Le Bernardin) and those places absolutely pale in comparison to Brooklyn Fare. I've been here 5 times and it's been worth every penny every time. I've since moved to San Francisco and have yet to find a place that can hold a candle. I'll keep looking...\\n\\nDon't waste your time and money at the other spots - Chef's table is the real deal.\\n\",\n",

It's genuine and you can see that love come through in all of his fresh ingredients and delicate preparation.\\n\\nThere's really no point in me listing what I had, since as Cesar was saying he really likes changing things up and it is almost always different.

There were probably 20 courses, which left you satiated, but not full. \\n\\nI didn't go for a 5 star rating here, and likely would have gone lower due to service, but I wanted to lean my rating more toward the food.  I was pretty unhappy with how my family was treated prior to eating at Chef's Table, as we all got very sick the week before our reservation, and when my father-in-law called to cancel and mentioned that we had the flu, the restaurant pushed that they in fact had a week in advance cancellation policy. So, if you don't cancel a week before they will charge you your full meal price. So if we all didn't go, we would be out over $1000. \\nSo my husband and I, not feeling great sucked it up and went, and we last minute wrangled in two of our friends to come instead of having two empty seats and over 500 bucks down the drain. \\nI understand having a fee for cancellation, this isn't unique but even $100 would have been reasonable, the full meal price just seemed exorbitant to me.\\n\\nNow onto the food. I love seafood and sashimi, so if you like those things, you will be in luck. They had many standout fish courses, and sashimi of fish from Japan I had never heard of. The crab and lobster were amazing, and I never normally like duck, but their duck dish with crispy skin was so tender and not gamey at all. My husband loved the foie gras and the kobe beef. All in all the execution of the courses was timed very well, and the presentation enticing. \\n\\nI preferred this tasting courses I've had to other 3 Michelin starred dinners I've had, as it's more the food I would normally order for myself, vs. something more conceptual, but the customer service, before and during the dinner (the staff didn't seem overly happy to be there) leaves something to be desired.\\n\",\n",

A lot of uber fresh sushi/sashimi based dishes, which I loved (but I guess if raw fish isn't your thing that might be a problem - they do make some accommodations for dietary restrictions though).  As daunting as the course number may sound, it was actually just perfect - you come away feeling completely satisfied but not uncomfortably full.

       " 'After having been a patron at number of New York establishments with brilliant food and service, it appalls me when a restaurant that is said to have wonderful food sorely lacks with their level of customer service, mainly how gosh darn annoying it is to get a reservation, and once you do, how poorly they treat you even before you\\'ve stepped foot inside.\\n\\nThis review might be different if I hadn\\'t been to other restaurants with food at the same caliber as Brooklyn Fare\\'s (not to be snotty, but I\\'ve been several other 2 and 3 Michelin starred restaurants, so this is an apples to apples comparison).  But, I have been to those restaurants, and I wasn\\'t met with a busy signal each time I tried to call.\\n\\nAt at this level of food, for a common foodie\\'s palette such as mine (since I don\\'t claim to be a professional food writer), the food is pretty much all excellent and interchangeable, so it\\'s truly the SERVICE that makes the difference.  So, I will not comment on the food here.  \\n\\nWe were really excited, until we got their confirmation email, that stated \"Price  $ 185.00 pp plus tax and 20% service fee.\"  This was the first we had heard of the service fee, and we initially thought that they were now bundling the cost of the meal with mandatory gratuity.  Oddly, the email also stated: \"Gratuity is not included it is at your discretion the evening of your dinner.  Gratuity is CASH ONLY.\"  (And yes, that was in caps)  Weird, right?  Why would there be a mandatory \"service fee\" and cash gratuity?  It does not cost that much to process a credit card...\\n\\nThey also need to decide if they are BYOB or not, as the email said they were currently BYOB but it \"may change.\"  I mean, at that point, if you\\'re not BYOB at the time of the confirmation email, don\\'t keep us guessing, because I don\\'t want to put down on nice wines from my local wine shop only to be kept from drinking them with my meal.\\n\\nOh, and they required non-refundable pre-payment.  I mean, I think if people have been willing to jump through the hoops to make a reservation, they will be able to pay.  And this totally screws anyone should they need to cancel unexpectedly (and from what I hear the waitlist would pretty much cover any cancellations).\\n\\nAND THIS ALL HAPPENED BEFORE WE EVEN DINED.\\n\\nOverall, I highly encourage them to make the ENTIRE Brooklyn Fare experience special for their guests.  It\\'s the service and attention to guests (in addition to food), that places such as Per Se, Jean Georges, and Eleven Madison Park keep people coming back.  \\n\\nI don\\'t see myself attempting to dine at Chef\\'s Table again anytime soon.\\n',\n",
       " 'The few times I have been have each been unique and delicious.  The courses are small but packed with flavor.  It is the best bang for the buck for a 2+ michelin star restaurant in new york imo. \\n\\nThe downside is reservations can be a pain (Amex is helpful), and the chef has a strict dress/ no pictures or dietary accommodations policy.  It was so good we tried to order extra courses to no avail.\\n',\n",
       " \"Food is good; Service (especially the Chef's attitude) falls very short. If you have more than $200 to spend per person on a meal, there are many other stellar options. \\n\\nReservations (As expected)\\nYes, it is a pain to make a reservation here. But that's the reality of any good restaurant, where demand exceeds supply. So no surprises there. \\n\\nTaste / plating of food (As Expected)\\nFood was good, and comprised of 17-20 courses. Cooked well, very tasty. What was missing was a description of what to expect from each course. \\n\\nDescribing food / food service (Below expectation)\\nThe people serving were just reciting the name of the dish + condiments without giving any more color. This is a marked difference from any other top restaurant where the waiters make every effort to tell you what to expect, and what tastes to watch for. \\n\\nTable Service (Significantly below expectation)\\nHere is where it got interesting. We were discussing differences and opinions re: our experience at the different restaurants we have been to. What we did not realize was that the waitress was eavesdropping, and she decided to go tell Cesar Ramirez about our conversation. Mr. Ramirez then chose to come up to us, and state that he is not trying to be like any other restaurant, he just wants to cook good food. Highly disappointing that the Chef felt there was a need for him to come and try to have the last word. \\n\\nLeft us with a very bad taste re: the entire experience, and convinced us that we will never go to Chefs Table at Brooklyn Fare ever again. The restaurant might have three Michelin stars, but what worth are those stars if you make your patrons feel so unwelcome. The best restaurants listen to their customers, and recognize that there is always room for improvement. \\n\\nWhen you are chided by the head chef for voicing opinions (in a city that is the center of capitalism) - maybe it is better to avoid the restaurant in favor of others where customer service is still king. Especially when you are paying $200+++ for a meal. \\n\\nTL; DR (Too Long / Didnt Read): Food is good, Service leaves a lot to be desired. If you have money to spend - pick another restaurant.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Let me start by saying that I HAVE actually eaten here, unlike some other reviewers that feel the need to give up after the yes, quite challenging task of getting a reservation. (If you don\\'t dine, don\\'t review!)\\n\\nGetting a reservation is difficult but it IS possible and you don\\'t have to KNOW someone to get a seat. You just have to be willing to put in a little time on a Monday morning.\\n\\nThere are some common themes among other reviews. Some call the service \"robotic\", others would call it choreographed. The chef is quiet, shy and focused, he doesn\\'t give you an elaborate story behind the creation of each dish, he tells you what you are eating and lets you know when you should enjoy it all in one bite. He is passive but friendly and will happily answer questions if you ask him at a slow moment. The atmosphere is quiet and intimate but shouldn\\'t be confused with being pretentious. The chef and staff work diligently at their craft but at the end of the day seem to realize that their food is still in fact, food. \\n\\nThis is not a typical restaurant, nor does it claim to be so the style of dining is also not typical. This is not the type of place that you bring your group of friends to celebrate a birthday or a promotion or to catch up on what they\\'ve been up to since you last saw them. This is a place to try perfectly paired ingredients of the highest quality. Its very simple. Watch. Taste. Reflect. Discuss. Repeat.\\n\\nThe food was perfect. I mean, truly spot on. Decadent and simple, over the top and classic all at the same time. Truly a unique dining experience and one that forces you to appreciate each bite and then move on from it just as quickly.\\n\\nI walked in wondering if the experience would warrant the effort and expense enough to go back again. I walked out wondering how anyone could not go back again and again.\\n',\n",
       " \"Brooklyn Fare  - Chef's Table\\n\\nWe had four people calling this place non-stop and one of us got through. Yay. \\n\\nThe German riesling (by the glass) here is the best that I've tasted ever - refreshing, crisp, and sweet.\\n\\nThe plates that were used with each course (from France - le Corquet?) were all very delicate, beautiful and modern. I just wanted to take each one home with me. \\n\\nMy impression is that each dish only included the finest ingredients known to man. \\n\\nThe starting butternut squash shooter with yogurt was very boring but the progression became more interesting over time. The beginning of the tasting included many sashimi pieces (red snapper with ponzu, blue fin tuna, saba, shima aji, mackerel, Tasmanian trout, etc) with perfectly complimenting sauces and seasonings. There was also a Kumamoto oyster with key lime gelee that was pretty good but kind of boring in my opinion (Kumamoto oysters are kind of like a starter oyster for people who don't eat oysters). The caviar course is great for caviar-lovers but I've never been one, so it was just an OK dish for me. Those dishes were the boring ones but they were very tasty. \\nMy favorite of the tasting was the seafood soup which included tofu, sea urchin, abalone, eel, and foie gras. The octopus course and the sea urchin with truffle were fabulous, as was the one with the lean foie gras, veal ravioli, and a couple of other items. Another dish was the red mullet with the sea urchin risotto/rice, which I thought was interesting but not as delicious as some other courses. The Portuguese sardine dish was good. There was a smoked applewood dish but I can't seem to remember which one that was. The heaviest was the duck, which was cooked to a raw medium perfection with a little bit of fat still left - I could cut through it pretty easily and it wasn't gamey at all. The sauce on the duck could have been better. Dessert included a tangy ice cream (similar to pinkberry) with lots of gold flakes on top and a cheese plate. I remember a red wine and port reduction sauce but I forget which dish it was on (haha). There might have been lobster somewhere. \\n\\nI'm sure I've left out a few dishes here and there (I did the tasting many days ago). Chef Ramirez can certainly be intimidating but he is also very attentive and helpful in telling us what we were eating. The crew definitely leave out the details in presenting you with each course so you kind of have to guess what ingredients are in certain dishes. \\n\\nOverall, an incredible experience.\\n\",\n",
       " 'At least with Mussolini the trains ran on time.\\n\\nI ate at Chef\\'s table last night. I am a foodie to my core. i ate there with foodies. Heck when i sat down I found that another of the small group in my seating was a friend and foodie (what were the odds?). The comon thread was that we each came for a great night of food and general culinary conviviality (as a rule these small group tasting menus turn into a communal experience, everyone commenting, sometimes drinking each others wine to add to the experience and are an overall great time). That was not the case here.\\n\\nThe pacing here was almost robotic. \\'Course completed ...Must serve next course. ,\\' was the way it all functioned. No time to appreciate what had just been presented before the next plate hit the table. We did 23 courses at Robuchon and it felt like we were dining even as food fatigue overcame us all. A few less here and it felt like the goal was to get everything done as quickly as possible, diner be damned. There was adequate time after out seating to set up for the next group so I really don\\'t understand why the meal is paced as it was. This wasn\\'t a dining experience, it was, needlessly, a food 100 yard dash.\\n\\nI routinely tell friends that it\\'s all about the food. Some of the best meals I\\'ve had (or maybe some of the meals I\\'ve enjoyed the most) were served in ugly rooms, in sketchy neighborhoods by folks whose only formal culinary training had come as OJT. Great food trumps any of the other categories of review. I, generally, don\\'t care about décor, service or wine list too much at all, although I appreciate all when they are present. I care about what\\'s on my plate.  In every great meal I think the common thread is someone who loves food, loves what food does to people and appreciates those who appreciate what\\'s been done for them. Again, a component that appeared to be missing here or, if not missing, never for a moment displayed.\\n\\nEach dish was delivered by the Chef with a terse title and that was that, he\\'d then spin on his heels and move to the next dish. If you didn\\'t catch it, the hostess would repeat it for you but, again, all was dispassionate and robotic, the theme of the evening.  The service was seamless and the setting sublime (I love chef\\'s tables), and BYOB meant I drank far better wine than I would have been willing to pay for, but it was joyless, rushed and robotic and made what should have a memorable evening into just an evening.\\n\\nI know he\\'s got 2 Michelin stars. The food was fine, Each bite tightly constructed, presented beautifully in an ever changing array of dishware and once or twice it even made you say \"Wow\". A couple of wows in this many courses is, again, sub par. Try the experience at Mini-Bar and your jaw won\\'t close for days from the Wows you\\'ll utter. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry. I know many speak glowingly of their experiences here and we were just one group of diners, two if you count my friend and his entourage who just happened to be there. We all worked at getting the rezzies, did cartwheels when we did and traveled to this meal with the highest of expectations. Complex , yet largely unexciting, food competently prepared coupled with  joyless, rushed, robotic pacing do not combine for a positive experience. There are MANY places on the big island that execute the concept so much more hospitably that I tried not to compare as I wrote this. The ultimate question for us, after any meal, is \"Would you come back?\". The answer, you can guess, is No and, once they are no longer BYOB, my answer would become  Hell No!\\n',\n",
       " \"This is it. A stunning presentation of the best possible quality seafood in the world prepared in the most careful yet delicious ways. My wife, who is not the biggest fan of seafood enjoyed every course and was even convinced to have her first taste of uni. Chef Ramirez personally takes care of every guest and is present and plating every course with his expert team. This is the first time I've seen a head chef even in his own restaurant. Expertly chosen wine pairing by the most gracious and friendly somm, who adapted the pairing to our tastes and refilled our glasses when we drained them early! The captain was perfect and presented each course with grace and humor. I won't list the other 3 Michelin star restaurants that this restaurant betters, but I can think of at least three. Save up and hit the phone for that reservation, you will not be disappointed! And if you don't believe me and want an expert's opinion, check Eater NY's recent review. It is all that.\\n\",\n",
       " \"tl;dr version: We had a great meal but Alinea in Chicago still owns my heart.\\n\\nThe reservation: 400 calls before getting someone on the phone. The week was already full and I was placed in the wait list. A spot opened and we took it. The process is pretty stressful and will be even more if you want a particular date or day of the week.\\n\\nThe setting: half circle facing the kitchen. beautiful copper pans hanging. Chef Ramirez actually opened the door himself. Very nice and quiet decor. It is not a setting that invites conversation when in a party of 4 or more though.\\n\\nThe staff: I've read many reviews complaining about the service and something must have happened since because I really enjoyed the service. Discreet, professional and knowledgeable. The server knew each course and their component by heart. Special mention to the sommelier who was very nice and knew her way around cheaper wines as well as more expensive ones.\\n\\nThe food: The food was great. I'm not going to list all the dishes we were served because 1. I don't remember all of them and 2. the menu is changed almost daily. I had some minor issues with some of the dishes (a couple of them we over-seasoned and the sashimi preparation seemed quite acidic for my palate (but that may be a taste issue more than a flaw). Some dishes were amazing, such as the sea urchin with truffle, the flan with escargots or the desserts. But nothing totally blew my mind like I felt when we visited Alinea. No fireworks of flavor. just very clean and well presented dishes.\\n\\nWhat made me lean toward 5* instead of 4: Well, there is still not half grades in Yelp. I really appreciated the attention to the detail that chef Ramirez and his team put in each dish. Also, somehow, someone overheard that we were there for my fiancée's birthday and they had a candle on her dessert plate.\\n\\nWill I go back? If someone makes the reservation for me, definitely.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I thought I understood food. I thought I had tasted top notch ingredients prepared with a care and technical capacity that I could never duplicate.

It is THAT good.\\n\\nYes, this place is expensive and yes, it\\'s a gigantic pain to get a reservation. But, at this point, everyone knows that and I can\\'t understand why anyone would ding them for those things. If that bothers you, just don\\'t go. It\\'s OK, the sun will rise tomorrow and life will go on. But, if you can manage to snag a reservation and pony up the small fortune required to dine here, you\\'ll be blown away.\\n\\nThe setting is unique in that you are literally eating in the kitchen. All the food is prepared in front of you and if you need to use the bathroom you have to walk through the dish washing area to do so. But, despite being in a kitchen, it\\'s very comfortable, modern, and immaculately clean. There were three chefs working -- Cesar Ramirez and two sous chefs -- and service is provided by a single server along with a sommelier. It\\'s a small place with 18 seats but I felt incredibly comfortable and well served the entire night. I found the service to be friendly, efficient, and attentive which was perfect for this setting.\\n\\nThe meal itself is a 2-3 hour progression of 20+ (mostly) single bite plates. It\\'s extremely sea food and fish heavy but even if fish and seafood isn\\'t your thing, it\\'s worth going because the flavors are so incredibly unique. To be honest, I don\\'t even like fish but nearly every dish they put in front of me was spectacular. For me, the high points were a chawanmushi with hot broth and king crab along with a smoked cod (I think it was cod) with crispy potato bits and caviar. The chawanmushi with broth was rich, luxurious and packed with warm and decadent flavors. I can\\'t even really describe the smoked cod with caviar. It\\'s served in an egg shaped vessel that is filled with smoke. Eating it is truly an experience. The best description I can offer is that it\\'s like eating a campfire which probably sounds horrible, but you have to just trust that it\\'s amazing and incredibly unique.\\n\\nBrooklyn Fare is, hands down, the best dining experience I\\'ve ever had.

Your not going to get the foraged mushroom  from a park in Brooklyn here or local sustainable oyster your going to get the best mushroom in the world wherever it is and it's going to sit infront of you with minimal accoutrements to make sure you know that the mushroom is the star of the plate and not because it's a fad or a popular way to serve food.

This was a few days after where it became a 3 Michelin star restaurant from originally being a 2 Michelin star.

If I had to rate my meal based on what I liked, it would be (1) the meal with the truffles and lemon sauce, (2) the uni with trout rho in some kind of rich zest sauce, and (3) the uni, shrimp, lobster soup.

But the place is all about me, me, me -- and the me is not you!  \\n\\nFor example, because it was BYOB (about 1-2 years ago), we were referred to their sommelier whose job, as we understood it, consisted entirely of helping customers go out and buy the right wines to match up with 20+ tasting courses.\\n\\nWe were treating our friends to the wine and we wanted the wines to be special and to go well with what we had heard would be amazing food.  The sommelier was very difficult to get a hold of for an actual conversation.  Then when I asked for guidance, such as can you describe the flavors / foods and what wines you\\'d suggest, I was told, No I can\\'t because the menu changes.  \\n\\nOK, fair enough.  Can you send me please a copy of a recent menu that I can bring into the wine shop so we can make some guesses?  Well, that took a crowbar but I got one.  After I finally had something to work with, I wanted just a second brief chat to actually get back to what we asked for from day one -- some guidance on the wines based on the example menu we finally had received.  At long last, I received some actual wine guidance: the suggestion that we bring 4 wines, and some thoughts on what types of wines to look at for each one of the 4.\\n\\nWhen we arrived a bit early for my special night, and to welcome our friends to the festivities, we were greeted with -- no lie -- : \"Oh.  You\\'re the people who needed so much help with wine.\"\\n\\nWHA?\\n\\nAnother important point.  Don\\'t expect to enjoy conversing even in quiet tones with your dinner guests.  We were a group of well-behaved parents in our 40s, and we were hushed and glared at over and over again by the chef\\'s staff, who apparently felt that we were insufficiently reverential.  Far from a birthday spirit.\\n\\nAs I said, at Chef\\'s Table at Brooklyn Fare, it\\'s all about me, me, me.  It\\'s sad really.

       " 'This meal was both incredibly expensive and incredibly delicious. It definitely was not local/seasonal (fish flown in from Japan that day, etc.) if that´s something you are into. Also, the setting is modern chic, but small (12 seats, in a U-shape).\\n',\n",
       " \"(I came here when the price was $180 for the meal, not including service.  At the time it was BYO, that has changed as well.)\\n\\nI'm going to keep this brief since: a) the hype is already so prevalent that you've heard a lot about it already; b) each  meal is different, and c) there are only so many ways I can say I loved the meal...\\n\\nPut simply, the food is incredible, and the overall experience is really one-of-a-kind.  Every dish is made right before your eyes, so me and my friend tried to guess each plate (and incorrectly almost every time)... and we ooh'd and aah'd at each dish as it was brought out and explained to us.  No dish disappointed (which is saying a lot since there are around 25 dishes), and more importantly with an experience like this, every dish was 'unique' and had ingredients that I never had before - with a focus on fish.  \\n\\nIt's definitely a pricey meal, but you know that much going in.  If you're prepared to spend a lot of money on top-notch/rare ingredients, prepared well - then you'll enjoy this 3-hour experience.\\n\",\n",

       " \"One of the highlights of my trip. This meal had a slew of one-bite amuses that preceded the official, pre-printed menu. I got an oyster with yuzu gelee, king crab with a sliver of watermelon radish, a completely elevating cube of compressed watermelon with olive oil and sea salt. Soooo delicious! Great food and great atmosphere...it's also BYO ;)\\n\",\n",

       " \"If you have tried this one, i hardly think any other restaurant can surpass. No fancy decoration but just a pure respect to food taste itself gives a WOW. And the taste stays on my mind. Even though Le bernadin is the most famous seafood restaurant in nyc, i seriously doubt that is because those people cant get reservation at Chef's table and I believe this is the best seafood I have ever had (there are over 10 dishes I had that are based on seafood, most from Japan). The most unforgetable plate is the urchin with black truffle on top!!!!! So far, it is the best of michelin 3 star I have tried. And I will go back.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Well, my brother and I made it out to Brooklyn Fare, the next biggest thing in the dining world. I was so happy that he told me about it and decided to make a reservation for us. You book 6 weeks out, so cancellations are common.\\n\\nI do not know how you can have a bad experience here. They do not accept food allergies or vegetarians... so all meat eaters should be satisfied here. I did not even have swine or cattle, and I was a happy meat eater.\\n\\nYou bring your own wine, meaning as much as you want to spend, and as much as you want to bring. With 2 bottles of wine and a bottle of beer in hand, the only way your meal could go bad is if you really do not like the grub that is served or if you pick terrible booze.\\n\\nThe format and pace of the dinner is near perfect. They keep you eating every few minutes or so with a bite or two of something awesome. There is no sense in going into too many details with the food, as I am certain that no one will have anything close to my menu after reading this review and getting in 6 weeks later. Plus, I cannot remember every single dish...\\n\\nThe chef is very focused on his food, so do not expect him to constantly be talking about each dish. Just sit back and enjoy whatever he puts on your plate. Again, he does not have any sympathy for vegetarians and individuals with food allergies. Nice.\\n\\nMy menu was very citrus- and fish-oriented. Definitely very fresh, vibrant, and clean dishes. Salt is heavily used, but it is a perfect complement to all of the open-ended flavors. The silverware used to eat each dish is also very unique... almost confusing, but fun. They are made to help you get everything into one bite.\\n\\nSome of the highlights include a toast that used foie gras and truffles; a custard that used uni, foie gras, and truffles; and lots and lots of good pieces of fish. Just think about those offerings...\\n\\nThe service makes the experience really smooth, and the staff is extremely precise in what they do. The dishwashers must really stay busy... there is not a huge amount of serving stuff to go around.\\n\\nIf you get a chance to have dinner here, do it. Try to go ASAP, as BYOB may not last much longer at this Michelin two star eatery. BF was one of the best meals that I have ever had, and it is certainly worth the steep price. Guaranteed.\\n',\n",
       " \"Wow...truly an amazing culinary experience.  18 small courses before the actual entrees started and each bite was perfectly crafted in both look and taste. \\n\\nBy far the standout for me was the uni on truffled toast and I can't wait to go back and see whats on the menu in the fall.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Superb food.  Simply superb.  \\n\\nCouple of key points: \\n\\nThe chef has an attitude, in a good way.  This place is a worship house for food, and the guy has no patience for people who don\\'t have respect for his art, I respect him for that.\\n\\nDon\\'t go to this place if you are a vegetarian or have any kind of \"I eat this but not that\" kind of attitude.  You eat what you are served. You shut up and enjoy.\\n\\nAmazing china, one of the best I have ever seen.  Very simple, very elegant.\\n\\nAs someone pointed out before, if it is served in a spoon, eat it in one bite!! (Seriously!!!)\\n\\nChef is very nice and talkative if you show interest in food.  He showed the pictures of some of the less common fish to us in his iphone.  He gave me some advice on cooking and where to buy stuff.  When I commented how amazing the tatziki sauce served with one of the dishes was and \"demanded\" to know what kind of yogurt he uses, he actually brought out the yogurt from the refrigerator for me to write down the name.  Yes he has an attitude, but really, he is my kind of guy.\\n\\nOver all, this was the best dining experience I have ever had and the best birthday gift I got this year, and I simply don\\'t have enough good things to say about this place.\\n',\n",
       " \"We ate there last night. We were an impossible group of 10. We were treated pretty well but really, I don't go out to chat with the waiters. The food was perfect. My only minor complaint was the two bottles of dessert wine we didn't drink. That was a waste. But I would go back in a heartbeat. They deserve the 3 stars!\\n\",\n",
       " \"They are very serious about their dress code. BF thought he can get away w wearing a pair of nice jeans. Nope! He had to Macy's to buy a pair of pants.

       " 'I wish I wrote this as soon as the dinner ended to remember all twenty five dishes. I loved the seafood heavy menu and the desserts were excellent. We started with a warm squash soup with orange and it was a perfect way to start, since it was chilly outside. Some memorable dishes included the lobster, the seafood soup, the clam, the oyster, the tuna and the all of the desserts.\\n\\nIt took about 6 weeks to get a reservation for the birthday weekend for my girlfriend and it was well worth the wait (on the phone and for reservation). Thank you for the excellent service and emails with the details.\\n\\nThere was a birthday at every seating. Pretty funny. The seating on Saturday started at 7PM and then we started at 7:45PM, then 10PM and the last one at 10:45PM. Worth the experience. Next stop Le Bernardin for more seafood delight.\\n',\n",

The whole meal lasted around 2.5-3 hrs\\n- The chef comes around to say hi which was very nice.

The first 8-10 were one bites with more 2-3 biters coming in the next 6 courses followed by 1 cheese plate and 2-3 desert plates\\n- One bite courses are mainly exotic and inventive fish dishes that are impeccably presented.

My lady who is not the most fervent raw fish eater enjoyed every course\\n\\nWine:\\n- Fabulous selection.  Wines start around $60 and run all the way up\\n- Wasn't clear if they had a Sommelier but the lady who helped us was well informed and helped match the 3 bottles of wine with the progression of courses.  We knew what we wanted, so it wasn't a huge issue for us\\n- Fantastic desert wines by the glass as well\\n- Nice feature: they laminated the label and the chef wrote a personal message to my friend on the back to congratulate him on his recent engagement.  Above and beyond.\\n- Note: the wine can easily double the food check\\n\\nOther:\\n- One of the utensils they give you is a two pronged fork.  Found that awkward to eat with\\n- They should do a better job whisking your coats away when you first get in. We went on a very cold night, but they eventually come by to get your coat\\n- Note: small place so there is a one person bathroom. No big deal just wanted to note it\\n\\nFully deserving of all its stars, this chef has not lost his focus.  While not cheap, I felt this was 100% worth the money.  Of course for special occasions, but I can't wait to find a reason to go back (and a reservation)!\\n\",\n",

       " 'Ok, so I know I\\'m going against the tide, but this is of course mine and my boyfriend\\'s personal experience.\\n\\nTo begin with, we found the \"getting a reservation experience\" much easier than expected and the gentleman taking our calls very accommodating. Being that we were in New York for only a couple of weeks, we were thrilled to be able to get a reservation on our last evening, and were treating it as being the highlight of the trip.\\n\\nLeading up to the night, we were instructed of course on all the rules- no cell phones, no photos etc. Even though it felt like a \"soup nazi\" list, we were still excited and ready for the dining experience of a lifetime (being all that had been written). Due to the fact the reservations are hard to come by, paying before was fine but requiring tipping before seemed a little presumptuous. \\n\\nWe both have eaten at three star Michelin rated restaurants in the US and Europe before, so we weren\\'t green to the prospect of exceptional food and service. Unfortunately this is not what we got. \\n\\nThe start of the night began just fine. Everyone seemed friendly and although the chef was not chatty he greeted us with a smile. So now for the bad elements. Firstly, the lady next to me was on her phone constantly and evidently invisible to the rest of the staff. You\\'re sitting right next to the person on either side as it\\'s one large table, so her constant texting and commenting (as she became more and more drunk) was increasingly annoying. I\\'ll get to the food in a minute. The chef was quiet to the room except for two ladies who seemed to have been stealing his time by creating some kind of drama by leaving the room with him and the manager then returning only to have him preoccupied for the rest of the evening.\\n\\nNow for the food. We knew it was heavy seafood but did not expect around 90% to be seafood and raw. Some of the items were very innovative  and very flavorful but not out of this world as we were expecting. The menu seemed very unbalanced and quite frankly, unsatisfying (bizarre for a large tasting menu). Squab was the only meat dish served and left us craving for more. Dessert was mediocre and could be found in any average restaurant. What you have to remember is that this is a three star Michelin rated restaurant and expectations and prices are extremely high. My boyfriend is a French trained chef who has worked in two and three star Michelin restaurants in New York and France, so he really knows his food on a different level, and he commented that the fish was not that fresh, especially for a top rated restaurant.\\n\\nTo conclude. He ended up violently ill (presumably from one of the many seafood items), I ended up hungry and we both ended up extremely disappointed. When we emailed after the dinner to express our experience, we didn\\'t even get a courtesy email to say sorry or even acknowledge the email at all! We were shocked that such a high caliber restaurant wouldn\\'t even return our correspondence, especially since we wrote twice! \\n\\nOverall it left a sour taste in our mouths and we felt lucky we had experienced other wonderful New York restaurants before this one. Wish we had saved the $600 for somewhere else!\\nAs a side note, you may want to read the filtered reviews also. I was beginning to think we were the only unsatisfied customers.\\n',\n",
       " 'Probably the second best meal of my life after Alinea.  Exquisite atmosphere and some of the most impressive fish preparations you can imagine.  Only downside is that you share the communal table with the worst sort of boorish New York finance types.\\n',\n",
       " 'From what I had read, this wouldn\\'t be just any fancy meal. Brooklyn Fare is also the name of the gourmet grocery store next door and five times a week the chef, César Ramirez, prepares a huge meal for a very intimate group. But the whole thing is under the guise of a class. You have to reserve a spot in advance (or get on the waiting list as I did back in February), bring your own wine, and then César teaches you about cooking, while cooking for you, and from reviews and word of mouth, you get to try amazing food.\\n\\nWe arrived at 7 and were greeted by a sweet waitress. It almost felt like a community of \"students\", but it never fully got there for me. Maybe my expectations were too high - or maybe the whole concept has changed since word of mouth has made it a bigger deal. But this was not a class. It was maybe an observation. But there was no introduction, no greeting, we barely heard the chef explain each dish as we received it. He sort of mumbled what it was and if you caught it, you caught it.\\n\\nBut even if you didn\\'t know what you were eating, it was still all ridiculously delicious. The amuse bouches started coming fast and furious. There must have been close to 10 little bites. And they were all outstanding.\\n\\nI specifically remember a watermelon slice perfectly coated with olive oil and sea salt, a sardine strapped to a potato chip, and a plump oyster with oyster gelatin and yuzu. Every single bite was explosive with texture and balanced flavors. I knew we were in for something truly special.\\n\\nThen we referred to our program (read: menu) which was the only hint that there was a syllabus. The eight courses were divided thusly: salmon, tomato, scallop, egg, black bass, ravioli, beef, strawberry. Now I have to do my best to remember the specifics of each. It explicitly said on the menu not to take notes or photos. It hinted that it was because they want us to enjoy the food without any distractions. So for the first time in a while, I had to rely on my mental note taking skills.\\n\\nThe salmon was a parfait (that was almost as small as the amuses) with lots of fish roe and a rich egg cream of sorts. It was good, but I didn\\'t realize we had technically started the meal. I was waiting for some direction or lesson. I guess all I needed to do was eat. And I did it.\\n\\nThe tomato course was probably his masterpiece. We watched as the sous chefs all helped compose the six-part dish that featured tomatoes every possible way you can imagine. Even the ways you can\\'t imagine, including my favorite: the tomato marshmallow. Each component was explosive with flavor. And you kept finding more components to the components, like the little gazpacho underneath the white tomato mousse. And of course, as almost an afterthought (or palate cleanser), we got a scoop of some sweet, spicy tomato sorbet. It was fantastic.\\n\\nEverything was a surprise: the poached egg was topped with rich, earthy summer truffles, the ravioli held some tender rabbit meat, and the beef had a rich buttery foie gras on top so if we weren\\'t full enough, we were certainly stuffed by the time dessert rolled out.\\n\\nExcept it wasn\\'t completely satisfying. I felt the meal sort of fizzled out. Don\\'t get me wrong: I loved every little thing we ate. It was so masterfully prepared and presented with seasonal ingredients and unique combinations. Everything was great. But I wanted more. And before you think me greedy, let me explain. The strawberry dessert was fresh and summery with a tangy greek yogurt sorbet. But after all those canapes to start, I thought we would maybe have a petit fours or two (or four). I still wanted closure - both with the meal (chocolate would have been nice) and with the show itself.\\n\\nThe chef tended to really engage the people on both corners of the long bar. We were smack in the middle and while we got a nod or two (and probably had the best visual seats in the house), I felt a little gypped. Maybe my expectations were too high after that bang of a beginning. Maybe the \"class\" has changed since it\\'s grown in popularity (they will soon be getting a liquor license and are now seating more people each night). Maybe those couples on either end were regulars (although I\\'m not sure how that\\'s even possible). I don\\'t know, but I left a little unfulfilled (while pleasantly full).\\n\\nThe Kitchen at Brooklyn Fare served fantastic food and it was a really exciting (albiet) expensive evening out. I did feel like I was involved in some secret club, but that only the most exclusive people could get front seats. And I wonder if those guys walked away with a chocolate truffle or two. Because I had to get mine at the grocery store next door.\\n\\n-eatthisny\\n',\n",
       " \"The place is a unique concept. Only 18 seats around an open kitchen where the Chef cooks and preps his food in front of you with his team. This chef is mexican (though looking nothing like one), barks out the dishes he is serving, hardly smiles the whole 2.5 hours through our meal. He has 3 rules: no photo-taking, no notes-taking and no phonecalls at his table. Thank god he is quite a genius chef that we can all forgive him. \\n\\nThere is no menu. It is basically a fixed $135 per head, and a BYO place (unheard of, and the first I've ever been in NY). You get your own wine glass at a corner of the restaurant, and serve your own wine. Feels very much like eating at a friend's dinner party.\\n\\nAmazing food. Very seafood-based, which is awesome. He started with serving about 8 to 10 canapes, all small bites of different seafood and fishes. I remember a grilled sardine strapped within a crispy potato chip, a very good tomato raspberry soup topped with greek yoghurt emulsion and kumomoto oyster with oyster gelatin and yuzu. Very yumz.\\n\\nAfter these 10 small bites, the main menu started. I liked every course. There is about 8 course, and ends with a cheese course and a dessert. There's sweet sea urchin, lobster, more fish, poached egg with a huge shaving of white truffle and truffle oil topped with caviar (I can die happy just smelling this dish), wagyu beef, some ravioli with more shaved black truffle.\\n\\nAll good and enjoyable. And because the menu is so seafood-based, you do not feel that it is too rich and the plates are not large too. So every bite is manageable even though there are so many courses.\\n\\nCan't wait to find my next excuse to return!\\n\",\n",

       " 'This restaurant really lives up to the hype. Better than Per Se, Daniel, EMP, etc. in my book. The entire staff, including Chef Ramirez, were beyond friendly and considerate. We sat at the far corner of the 18-seat semi circle which I think are the best seats in the house as you get direct access to Chef Ramirez during his down time. Every dish was delicious, original and fresh. I will definitely come back.\\n',\n",
       " 'Chef\\'s Table serves some of the most delicious fine food that I have ever tasted.  Most restaurants with 3 Michelin stars go beyond what is delicious into a territory of taste which is not of interest to me personally.  Not so here.  Each dish with only one exception was exquisitely enjoyable. The single exception was the cocoa covered rice cake with an orange spherical mousse served as the last course which tasted slightly spoiled  - many of the diners did not finish it.  The fact that it was the last dish and was fatally flawed was rather unfortunate, but this was not the reason for my average evaluation of this experience.  Instead it was the service which fell far short of my expectations.  One waitress trapped between the kitchen and the bar seating served all 18 or so diners, and to put it simply one waitress wasn\\'t enough.  When opting for a fine dining experience, my expectation is that I will be treated as a special guest.  Instead, I was given short introductions to each dish and my questions were answered late, briefly, or not at all.  Additionally, the sommelier was cool in his treatment of us to a fault.  In fact, \"icey\" is the best description I can think of for the service that night.  Ultimately, this made me feel un-welcome and un-important.  This is no doubt a subjective criticism, but it was true for me - For me this was a 1 star experience because instead of an evening of celebration I was subjected to something more like 3 hours of being shushed at the ballet. This 3-star rating accounts for the food - which was in fact exceptional and impressive.\\n',\n",
       " \"im extremely surprised at the select bad reviews, but hey, everyone's experience is different, maybe on those particular days, the Chef/server(s) had bad days themselves?  not sure....\\n\\nwhat i can say is i LOVE this place.  we love it so much that we try to go once a quarter, but given how expensive it is, the limit is once a quarter, no more.  and every time we go, we try to take diff ppl w/ us to experience, so we've always had reservations for 4.\\n\\nhow should i describe BK Fare, you know how food critics sometimes say, theres a symphony of flavors in my mouth?  well, thats exactly how i feel!  not to say EVERY dish is like that but pretty darn close!!!  and theres nothing gimmicky abt this place, just PURE GOOD FOOD.  to me, its the best bang for your buck in terms of 3-star restaurants b/c of the amazing ingredients they use; no carrot tartare, for example....\\n\\nthis is the ONLY restaurant we go to on a regular basis and the BEST restaurant ive ever eaten at.  Cesar is welcoming at least every time we've been, in fact, the 2nd time we went, which was a whole yr after the very 1st time (we started going once a quarter after the 2nd time), he remembered us from a yr ago and made sure to stop by/say hello!\\n\\nLOVE LOVE LOVE.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Just came back from the restaurant that we had to wait almost 2 months.It was very interesting experience. But I\\'m still hungry..... As most you know that you don\\'t know what you get until they serve you. Even on the menu it doesn\\'t explain much. Most of the meal was one bite dish. Food was definitely good but did it worth $135? I would say \"NO\" it because I still am hungry after the meal. The quality was great. Most of the meal was seafood. You can tell that they are using very fresh fish. \\n\\nWe brought both red and white wine. We finished both. It\\'s great that they are BYOB. The biggest complaint I have is the desert. They served us sorbet and ice cream. How can they serve 2 cold desert? Is it sort of common sense in the cooking world that if you serve cold desert, you serve warm (baked) desert for the next? I was very satisfied until the desert came. No coffee, nothing.\\n\\nLike I said before, it was a good experience. I\\'d not probably going back there anytime soon.\\n',\n",
       " \"This was the best f*cking meal I've had in New York, and was as close as you could get culinarily to sexual intercourse. \\n\\nI apologize in advance for missing any details about the meal, but like all great meals (like great sex in general), it's the sustained crescendo of tastes, smells, and sensations that make a one-night stand like this so sustainably memorable.\\n\\nWhat makes Chef Cesar Ramirez's tasting so exceptional was that each dish was completely unique, memorable, and different across the twenty-or-so courses throughout the service.  Combine this with the laid back atmosphere of being seated in a working kitchen, this is one of the only three Michelin-starred restaurants that feels as comfortable to dine in as your living room.\\n\\nThe entire twenty-course meal started with a palate cleanser: a cucumber soup shooter topped with foam. The intensity of the cucumber was subtle, but the creaminess of the foam and the herbalness of the soup seamlessly washed over the palate.\\n\\nNext were a range of sashimi dishes in a variety of sauces that would make you forget that Chef Ramirez used to work in high-end French restaurants like Bouley, rather than Japanese ones. The highlights included striped horse mackerel with a ginger reduction and crispy ginger garnish, fluke topped with crispy scales, oysters in a buttercream sabayon, and the coup d'etat, uni on brioche garnished with a shave of Australian truffle. The latter was by far the highlight of the night: the rich, unctuous savoriness of fresh sea urchin battled with the deep, funky earthiness of truffle, yet the combinations of both intense flavors neither overwhelmed nor overpowered each other. Like all great dishes, it deflowers any previous assumptions about food.\\n\\nAfterwards were several small entrees: Burgundy snails in garlic sabayon, duck with chanterelles and porcini cream sauce were among the highlights. \\n\\nDesserts left the meal on a high note: cantaloupe sorbet, shiso sorbet with blueberries and gold leaf, and lemon tart with balsamic gelato. The latter was one of my favorite desserts of all time: the lemon custard hauntingly intertwined with the deep vinegary richness of the balsamic sorbet: like great Bach fugues, there were two different flavors marching to different paces, but uniting to create a magical melody of tastes.\\n\\nService was meticulous and on point (what you expect from a front-of-house team run by Per Se free agents).\\n\\nAt only 15 pages., the wine list was very well edited and though out, but there are no hidden gems or values on it. If you decide to bring a bottle, be prepared to shell out $70 for corkage, which is rather high, but this keeps the lights on for this streamlined, three Michelin-starred restaurant.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you will have to pay about $300/pp for the privilege of eating at a chef's table where you have to book six weeks in advance. People will complain. Regardless, Chef Ramirez is the star of the hottest culinary rock show in town, and I will gladly scalp tickets from anyone who doesn't want to pony up for one of the most mind-blowing culinary experiences in NYC.\\n\",\n",
       " 'So disappointing. My experience was so vastly different from those who agree on the Michelin three stars. Only three of the small plates were worthy of being called spectacular, the rest were serviceable, the only moment I was grateful for the minuscule-even-by-tasting-standards portion size. The presentation was not as advertised (\"20+ courses, predominantly shellfish\") which was not in itself problematic. The great letdown was that from a culinary and pragmatic standpoint the meal did not honor a novelty or juxtaposition of ingredients that was either inspiring or comforting enough to leverage the expenditure of the associated time and cost. Going from serviceable to subpar, the shiso intermezzo(?) tasted like a frozen puree of astroturf and soymilk. The dessert course was disarmingly nondescript except for the unpleasant, unrecognizable Postum-like aftertaste it left. The most off putting aspect of it all was the chef\\'s cursory walk around the room: so disinterested and unengaging it looked forced. If he is that uninterested in people, how can he cook for them? At a cost of hundreds of dollars per person bringing back the age of perfunctory, unaccomodating better than thou hospitality without the food to back it up is audacious. I recommend to those that want to invest well in a complete experience, dine at Le Bernadin, still the gold standard for gracious, professional behavior and attention to ingredients that tell you they love what they do and don\\'t mind you being there.\\n',\n",

An absurdly unctuous piece of foie gras was too generous (yes, I said it) without the balance of any starch.\\n\\nBut what I experienced at the Chef\\'s Table at Bklyn Fare was something better than perfect. Chances were taken. Elements should not have fit together. Caviar bedded in fried potato bits? Black truffle shavings snowstormed over a Japanese risotto? Hot Parmesan-Reggiano foam over cold split-pea soup? Sardine and basil woven into a *potato chip*?

A bounty of canapes to start: sashimiesque fish with an underlying brushstroke of sauce and a floral garnish. After the fact, can I tell you which of the [hirame, saba, shima-aji, kinmedai, shake, toro, etc.] was paired with a subtle [ginger, shiso, cilantro, saffron, yuzu, trout roe]-based sauce and a [radish, orange, arugula, leek] blossom? No. Can I tell you that any of these fish could have held their own in the first-class Manhattan sushi temples, that the sauces kicked them to a different level, that each flower (anywhere else a mere pretentious flourish) contributed a wonderful bit of textural contrast as well as a flavor grace note... that these courses delivered on the promise that Sushi of Gari proposes but never quite fulfills, i.e., the translation of Japanese raw-fish elements into an exciting nouveau medium? Um, YES.\\n\\nWhat can I tell you about a Shikoku oyster nestled in a cup, a screamingly fresh slice of cucumber and a burst of creme fraiche hidden beneath, a translucent gelee layer vacuum-packed on top as if to preserve its beauty for future generations? How about that it was the most perfect oyster dish this side of the Grand Central Oyster Bar\\'s pan-roast? Or a round of toast topped with Hokkaido sea urchin and a slice of black truffle? That it deserved to join Marea\\'s uni/lardo starter and Kyo Ya\\'s uni/yuba delicacy in the pantheon?\\n\\nIt may be obnoxious to refer to other places, but touchstone, even legendary, dishes from those others are what came to mind: head-to-head comparisons with the very best that all of NYC has to offer. And BFare acquitted itself shockingly well, time after time after time. Wagyu tenderloin I\\'ve had at Del Posto, at Daniel, at Per Se... All trumped by BFare\\'s coarse, perfect salting and a wisp of plum sauce. A piece of langoustine, lightly battered then fried, defied the physical laws of heat transfer -- how could the crust be so exquisitely crisped, yet the crustacean within be so evanescently cooked? I can\\'t even think of a comparison for that one.\\n\\nA step back, to lesser plates: an octopus with marshmallow tenderness, but anodyne in flavor. A \"chawanmushi\" with mushrooms, a gloppy dashi base, and streamers of eggs more reminiscent of egg drop soup than the namesake dish. I told you, not perfect. I guess in some make-believe world, 30 straight high-wire plates could inspire you to hold up the \"Perfect 10!\" sign every time.\\n\\nBut I like a Tim Krabbe quote about chess: \"The initial position... is a draw, and any move after which it is still a draw must be seen as perfect. And such moves are very easy to find...: 1.d4 d5 2.Bf4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 e6 5.Bd3 Bd6 6.Bxd6 Qxd6... and so on: the kind of game you sometimes see between weak club players. The Perfect Game is not worth looking at.\"\\n\\nBFare is clearly not shooting for perfection like that. Instead, the tastes and the aesthetic are manifestly those of Chef Ramirez; his idiosyncratic imagination is for anyone to see. Yes, the standard ambitions are on the sleeves of everyone there: the head chef, the cooks, the servers... Even the customers! If they were like me, they spent 45 minutes hitting \"redial\" ad nauseum to get through to the restaurant at a precise time on a Monday morning six weeks prior (a forbidding task that had me PTSDing to the early Momofuku Ko days).\\n\\nBut his singular drive is the best argument in favor of a place that I was initially skeptical about. \"If it\\'s so Japanese-inspired, why not just go to my omakases instead?\" I\\'d wondered. 3 years of kvetching before I went, but I am here to tell you now: if you can\\'t understand the appeal of allowing such a sweeping yet intimate culinary vision to take residence in your head for a few hours, then I have nothing left to say to you.\\n\\nProbability of return within 1 year: 1%\\n',\n",

Since they renovated, the atmosphere is definitely a little more romantic.  It's a really personal dining experience where it really feels like you and the chef.

It's so good that I'm not going to tell you what I ate (also because I was in such food bliss, I've forgotten a lot of the things I ate in this almost 20-plate tasting).  It's not going to be the same next time you go anyway.  Just know that the ingredients are amazingly fresh and you certainly get what you pay for and more.  It's a fancy meal, no question about that, but because it's served so humbly that it's completely unpretentious and freeing so you can really just focus on the food itself.  Eating here really an inspiring experience as you listen to Cesar tell you about how he got to where he is and how things in his life have affected his cooking.  \\n\\nCheck this one out, but make a resy soon.

       " 'I have never had a more humiliating experience than when I had the unfortunate chance of dining at the Chef\\'s Table. I was with a party of 18 who had rented out the restaurant in December for the end of the year party, the hosts had pre paid for the full 18+ course dinner. One host brought quite a few nice bottles of wine and was pouring glasses to match our courses. The food was excellent, the hostess was pleasant while serving out about six sushi courses, and very accommodating when I informed her of an allergy.  it should have been a lovely evening- I would certainly hope so given the $400+ per person price tag which did not include wine. Unfortunately the only thing larger than the price tag was the chef\\'s ego. \\n\\nAfter the second non sushi course, he threw all of us out of the restaurant because we had not complimented him enough. But not before the hostess took the time to insult our character. \\n\\nApparently when one dines at the Chef\\'s table one must speak only of how delicious the food is, and one must do so after every course. One may not click the wine glasses together to make a toast, and god forbid one knock a wine glass from the narrow little counter where they place them when they were BYOB, otherwise the hostess will call the offender a drunk. Sadly we were not informed of these rules before we dined there. \\n\\nHere is what happened- to the best of my knowledge. \\n\\nApparently the chef was offended that during the sushi courses we started talking amongst ourselves and toasting to the end of the year, and generally having a good time. The host who brought all the wine was quite a collector, so he had a few things to say about the wines that we were drinking. The chef felt that some of the attention that should have gone to him was now going to the wine. He sent out two small meat courses after the sushi, then desert and told us to leave. He started cleaning the kitchen and repeated that dinner was over and we had to leave. \\n\\nOf course the people who booked the dinner were confused at first. The hostess informed us that we, as guests, were no longer welcome at their restaurant due to our poor behavior. Of course at this point we became upset and asked what kind of establishment this is. The hostess then raised her voice and said \"Have you thought about how you have been behaving? You have been clinking the glasses, you broke a glass, you are all drunks! We don\\'t do these sorts of dinners!\"\\n\\nI felt like John Belushi getting yelled at by Dean Wormer in Animal House.  \\n\\nWere we drinking? Of course, but we were by no means acting like a bunch of jackals. That hostess was so uptight about a broken glass (Which someone\\'s purse knocked off the narrow counter before a single bottle had been corked) and didn\\'t want people talking to each other between courses. Frankly, I don\\'t think the restaurant industry is the right place for people who can\\'t handle a broken glass or boisterous guests. They don\\'t do these sorts of parties? Well, then they never should have booked a party for a law firm. I will certainly never return. \\n\\nDid I mention that after being thrown out, insulted, and being served less than half the food, there was no refund?\\n',\n",

The food was all excellent with so many tastes and textures to experience.  Heavy focus on seafood - yellowtail, scallop, black bass and octopus, the latter so ridiculously tender and honestly unlike any I've had before.  And the sauces - sweet corn, bright kaffir lime, rich foie gras - everything was terrific.  A great culinary treat.\\n\\nThere's been issue taken in some of these reviews and in the TONY review with Chef's personality.  He is clearly very serious about cooking, and for the first 15-20 minutes the mood was a little repressed as everyone got a feel for one another.  But once the dishes started coming out and the guests started asking questions, I found Cesar nothing but pleasant and kind.  He answered questions, explained technique, talked about his passion for fine china, shared renovation plans, and enjoyed a glass of wine with all of us at the end.  I wouldn't call him the most gregarious Chef you'll come across, but I think if you are respectful of what he is doing, you'll have a great time.  This isn't your co-worker's neighbor's friend's dinner party, this is a serious dining experience; don't get it twisted just because there aren't white table cloths and no jacket is required.\\n\\nThe format is changing in July, as others have mentioned, but as long as Chef Cesar Ramirez and his team are cooking, this experience is definitely worth your time and money.\\n\",\n",

I understand keeping true to the food preparation and eating in a timely manner, but if we've paid for this meal already and we're late due to something we couldn't control, why can't you let us eat the missed dishes when we arrive?

The fact that it's BYOB for now which is an extra perk (better get there fast to take advantage of it - they are in the process of setting up a wine pairing, which will raise the price).  My favorites from all the courses was the fried langostine (had a savory saffron sauce on top), and a truffle-topped egg-like concoction (coolest magnetic serving plates ever).  The duck testicles (he didn't tell us what they were until after we tried them) were interesting, to say to the least.  The whole dinner (12 courses when I went), took around 3 hours.  \\n\\nSo why no five stars?  Personally I found the experience a little too sterile -- the restaurant lacked the warmth and coziness that I usually look for in a dinner out, but I guess that comes with eating inside a real kitchen.  There was a woman who was standing stiffly like a guard against the wall the whole time, which was a bit awkward.  Also, the metal bar stools were uncomfortable for that long of a time (wear pants with some cushionage).

       " 'I will open by stating that I have not eaten at the Chef\\'s Table at Brooklyn Fare and that I have *only heard raves* from people who have.  Three friends and I snagged a hard-to-get reservation there a few weeks ago for a special occasion in October 2011, and we were excited to go.  But we ended up canceling our reservation due to seriously confusing messaging regarding pricing and what we perceived to be insulting customer service policies on the part of the restaurant.  Bear with me and I\\'ll explain how the Chef\\'s Table lost our business:\\n\\n1. Cost of Meal: Auto-Gratuity\\nWhen we obtained the reservation, our understanding was that the cost of the meal per person was $185 before tax, gratuity and beverage costs.  A confirmation email sent by the restaurant a few weeks later stated: \"Price  $ 185.00 pp plus tax and 20% service fee.\"  This was the first we had heard of the service fee, and we initially thought that they were now bundling the cost of the meal with mandatory gratuity.  (I wouldn\\'t have had a problem with that, actually.  Per Se does the same thing.)  But the email also stated: \"Gratuity is not included it is at your discretion the evening of your dinner.  Gratuity is CASH ONLY.\"  (By the way, THE USE OF ALL CAPS IS REALLY CLASSY FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE JOINT.)  Taking the restaurant at their word, we assumed that the 20% fee did not represent the gratuity and reasoned the following cost structure per person (not including beverage): $185.00 (dinner) + 8.75% (sales tax) + 20% (\"service fee\") + 20% (standard discretionary gratuity).  This came to approximately $275...way more than what we originally expected to pay (and, btw, just $20 shy of the cost of dinner and service at Per Se).  As the restaurant stated to Eater.com, it turns out that its email was incorrect regarding the \"service fee,\" and it did intend for this fee to represent a mandatory gratuity charge.  (See http://ny.eater.com/archives/2011/09/brooklyn_fare_2.php).  So, the confirmation email was in error and (one would like to think not purposefully) misleading.  (The Eater post also notes that the restaurant has subsequently decided that pre-payment of gratuity is \"optional.\")\\n\\n2. Cost of Meal: Beverage Cost\\nThe Chef\\'s Table at Brooklyn Fare started out as a BYOB establishment, and this was definitely a major selling point.  When we got the reservation, however, a rep on the phone reported with certainty that the restaurant would have its liquor license by the date of our meal and would no longer offer BYOB.  We were slightly disappointed, but still generally excited for the meal.  Then the confirmation email came.  It read, simply: \"Currently BYOB (this may change).\"  We were perplexed.  So, we might have the option of bringing our own booze, but we may also be required to buy marked-up booze from the restaurant?  The restaurant was clearly hedging its bets, and we had no assurance that we would be informed in advance which policy would apply to our meal.  And we had no idea of knowing what kind of alcohol offerings and pricing the restaurant might adopt.  For all we knew, we might be forced to spend $100+ per person on a coursed wine pairing.  This was the real deal-breaker.  Is it unreasonable for a diner to expect to have some vague notion of how much they\\'ll spend at a restaurant in advance of their meal?\\n\\n3. Requiring (a Non-Refundable) Pre-Payment\\nThe restaurant required pre-payment by credit card seven days in advance of our reservation date.  At first this seemed understandable, as no-shows and last-minute cancellations could dramatically affect the profitability of such a business.  (It is an 18-seat restaurant.)  Yet again the restaurant\\'s confirmation email undermined my willingness to comply with this relatively unorthodox policy because it was not up-front about what costs required prepayment.  It stated: \"100% of the dinner fee will be charged 7 days prior to the day of the reservation and is non-refundable.\"  So, $185?  Or %185 + 20% service fee?  Or $185 + 20% + 8.75% sales tax?  Should one have to beg a restaurant for such crucial details?  And would they be following up in the event that BYOB was no longer an option and require pre-payment for previously unadvertised alcohol costs as well?  This confusion, coupled with the lingering question of whether if I got hit by a bus six days in advance of the meal I might be refunded by Brooklyn Fare (which would probably have plenty of time to leverage its wait-list) just added to the already unacceptable degree of frustration associated with this reservation.\\n\\nA lot of people have obviously really enjoyed their time at this restaurant.  For us, though, the confusing terms dictated by this business in advance of our reservation were unacceptable for a restaurant so highly regarded.\\n',\n",

       " 'Where to begin....\\n\\nIt took me several months to score a reservation here for one reason only - laziness and lack of follow through on my part.  The inexperienced who follow the rules and dutifully dial the reservation line at 10:00am on a Monday and will no doubt be met with a busy signal for the better part of a half an hour.  You may finally reach someone after several Mondays.  After two minutes, yours truly got wise and remembered that every successful business has at least two lines.  Hint: Use your talents and apply this knowledge when calling.  That\\'s all I\\'ll say....\\n\\nWe arrived about three minutes late to our 7:00pm seating for ten people.  I was terribly afraid we would lose our exclusive reservation as punishment for our tardiness and that the nearly $500 I had already paid in advance would be kept to teach me a lesson.  I cursed the F train traveling on the C Line and kept my fingers crossed. \\n\\nWe were greeted by the hostess when we arrived and told all was fine with a smile.  She took our coats and seated us at the first two seats to the right of where Chef Cesar Ramirez was standing.  Already I am at ease.  Allow me to clarify, this is not a restaurant, this is a kitchen.  Not just any kitchen either.  The Chef\\'s Table boasts an impressive arsenal in the form of shining stainless steel, gleaming copper and the highly coveted Molteni Stove, which I had previously learned is the only one of its kind in the U.S.  I commented to my boyfriend that had I known better eight years ago I would have surely invested in one of those instead of Las Vegas real estate.  It was easily worth at least twice what I paid for a house and no doubt worth four times more than that today.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was warm, romantically lit and quite elegant.  The stainless counter we were all seated around (and by all I mean ten people) was simply set with black place mats and a glasses of drinking water.  The Chef\\'s Table does not have a license to serve liquor but they do allow you to bring your own and graciously provide specific recommendations prior to arrival.  We elected to bring a half bottle of dry champagne to start, followed my Neumeyer Reisling, then Meursault Sous Le ville (a very nice white Burgundy) and finally the Flowers Pinot Noir.  All paired quite nicely with the meal and the hostess and Maitre D were helpful in advising when would be a good time to switch.  There is a section in the back of the kitchen where patrons can keep their bottles chilled or not, and all appropriate stemware is provided.  While some may be put off by the having to get up and retrieve their own drinks, I personally felt like it created a much more intimate, exclusive environment.  Like you were good enough chums with Georgio Armani that you could rise from the table and help yourself.  Or, in this case, a Three Star Michelin Chef.  \\n\\nI\\'m not even going to pretend to remember all of the dishes, there were at least twenty-five of them, each perfectly prepared, and each a perfect balance of delicate yet powerful flavor.  Delightful things like hickory smoked caviar, crispy leeks, fois gras and scallops, crispy seared duck, the list goes on and on.  \\n\\nWhat was perhaps the most memorable was being able to engage Chef Ramirez in light-hearted conversation about where to find truly good Mexican food in New York, and exchanging personal dining favorites.  Though entirely self taught, Chef Ramirez is extremely humble and was constantly checking in on me to make sure I was enjoying the food.  I unnecessarily informed him it was remarkable.  \\n\\n\"We always try to take the utmost care in everything we do here, it\\'s very important to us.\"  he said meekly.\\n\\nTo that end I have only this to say to the magnificent Cesar Ramirez....\\n\\nTo \"try\" implies failure, and YOU sir couldn\\'t possibly be any farther away from that.\\n',\n",

Your only other server is the sommelier, who delivers your wine from an extensive, high-priced and French Focused wine list. While this approach is unusual, it\\'s not novel (Momofuku Ko has a similar format). What really sets Chef\\'s Table  apart is that executive Chef Cesar Ramirez stands right in front of you the entire time and (when not preparing food) is chatting, delivering dishes and answering questions. He even hung around after the meal to discuss it with us for at least 30 minutes. Truly amazing.\\n\\nAs for the food, there are no photos or notes allowed and 20+ courses (most of them 1 bite) so I won\\'t be doing the usual rating of each dish. However, nearly everything was exquisite. Briefly, here\\'s what we received:\\n\\nAn amuse bouche of cucumber/lime soup\\nAround a dozen single bite fish courses, with fresh, exotic fish with a small amount of sauce. The sauces ran the gamut from salty to sweet to smokey. One of my favorites was an oysters with a granny smith apple and cream sauce. A scallop with caviar smoked table side was another highlight.\\nA single meat course of perhaps the most tender duck I\\'ve eaten.\\nAn all-in-one \"cheese plate\" consisting of thinly sliced cheese over a fig jam.\\nThree dessert courses including smomething resembling a strawberry shortcake and chocolates with banana cream and whiskey.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s expensive (at $225 a head + tax&tip) and reservations are hard to come by (call 6 weeks ahead on Monday at 10:30AM, repeat), the Chef\\'s Table is an experience like no other in New York and definitely worthwhile.\\n',\n",
       " \"Wow!  My new #1.  I traveled all the way from SF to eat here.  After each course I didn't think the chef could top it, but he did.  Thomas Keller you are on notice.\\n\",\n",
       " 'FOOD 4.5\\nSERVICE 4.5\\nFor $500 a head  including wine, this establishment now enjoys its sudden stardom from being a value BYOB chowhound heaven to joining its star-spangled peers like perse/11mad, well in this case, a sushi bar for the rich. The execution was spotless, well deserving its reputation, but the menu selection defies the purpose of its format, gets boring after 10 plates of lightly touched seafood in similar form. Liked the soy tuna, bluenose with zing,  hot and cold shooter, and the \"last bottle in the world wine\". Chef was nice but understandably seemed bored with the usual chatter about his japanese fushion style. Definitely needs to be a regular to register.\\n',\n",
       " \"Cesar Ramirez Rocks!\\n\\nThis is an amazing interactive experience worth every penny. In fact, I think it's a total steal for what you get. I like how you get to interact with Cesar. My girlfriend and I spoke with him for quite a while during and after our meal.\\nThis is the only place I've been where the chef describes each course prior to serving. Then he does the rounds and talks to every guest throughout the meal. This makes a stronger connection with the food and makes everything more personable.\\n\\nHe's got it down and I consider this to be like a mini Per Se. Everything he served was delicious. I highly recommend this place. Go now before he blows up... the prices could double and it would still be worth every penny.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Without a doubt the best meal of my life. Each dish was exquisite, the progression and rhythm of the meal told a story and it was an incredible one. The preparation is balletic, the flavors are unique and exciting. For weeks after eating at Chef's Table, the prospect of eating a meal composed of one pedestrian dish seemed so sad. Sometimes I would try to remember the sequence of courses at Chef's Table, and I was naturally unable to do so, but sometimes a dish would pop back into my mind, and it was thrilling.\\n\",\n",
       " 'So, we went for the 10pm (maybe it was 10:30, can\\'t remember) seating. We ordered several bottles of sake and they most certainly reached over my shoulder the entire 2 and half hours to refill my glass. And now that they\\'re serving you your choice of overly priced alcoholic beverages, I believe they\\'ve slowed down the coursing, so you can consume more alcohol and perhaps spend more on that alcohol because you are there for so long. There were times between courses that was agonizingly painful because it was so late and cold - we sat next to the door. I\\'m glad I had the experience, the food is amazing, I repeat AMAZING, but... I liked the BYOB much better and its just so d@nm expensive now!! Oh, and the chairs...if you\\'re any thing over 5\\'9\" are annoying, you sit so far from the dang bar and now that they\\'re serving your beverages over your shoulder, the waiters are constantly bumping into you. \\nPS - Our group of 4 was ~$1600 - food, drinks, & gratuity.\\n',\n",
       " 'We went here 2 nights ago after waiting about 10 weeks for our reservation. This dining experience is nothing short of brilliant.\\nThe space is non descript - white tiles and stainless steel but somehow the ambiance ends up being delightful given how small and intimate it is. Watching the food being prepared is fun and the every dish put in front of us was a gastronomic explosion. Almost every dish was a fish dish - 1 meat entree only. My favorites were the canapes: squash and yogurt soup, Toro dish, Oyster dish (less fond of langostine and sea urchin).\\nI cant wait to go back.\\n',\n",
       " \"Fiancé had been wanting to come here for awhile now. Decided to surprise him for his 30th birthday + our anniversary. \\n\\nWe arrived promptly at 6pm, to be greeted by Chef Ramirez himself. We were seated at the end, closest to the action. As soon as we were seated, we were offered flat or sparkling water along with a wine menu. Now, neither of us are big drinkers, but we could tell from the wall behind us that they had a wide selection.\\n\\nPlating and presentation of each dish was organized. Each staff member knew what they had to do. Moving in unison, one after the other. I really enjoyed watching them work. \\n\\nThis is being done by memory since we were told photos are not allowed, so forgive me for my lack of detail: We started off with an oyster in ponzu sauce shooter. It was incredibly fresh. It had enough meat to be satisfying, without that overwhelming fishy taste you get from ones such as Kumamoto oysters. We had 2 (or was it 3?) types of sashimi. The first was topped with fried kelp. It had a smokey flavor to it, which was different compared to the sashimi you get at a Japanese restaurant. Then there was a large helping of sea urchin over toast topped with a slice of black truffle. Yum! The chef had come over to ask us how everything was. I mentioned that I don't usually like sea urchin, but that it was quite good. There was a soup that had an egg custard at the bottom, Alaskan king crab and a slice of foie gras. If you've never had foie gras, it is very rich. I think putting it in soup really helped with that rich taste. There was an interesting dish with dashi cream and a big scoop of oscetra caviar. They had placed this dish in a glass orb and filled it with (hickory?) smoke before covering it. The one dish I thought was plated the prettiest was the lobster. Lobster tail with a baby carrot and onion, surrounded by some sort of foam, all on a large white plate. Truly lovely. There was also a cube of Wagyu beef. Melt in your mouth, cuts through like butter good. Then there was the duck. Prepared to perfection, incredibly tender. There were a few others such as the fish covered in a quinoa crust, abalone (divine), and one other fish that had a nice crispy skin but was incredibly moist on the inside. \\n\\nDinner ended 1st with a refreshing cucumber sorbet in a wine sauce.  2nd, strawberries with a yogurt sorbet. Then (my personal favorite) a chocolate shell that when hot chocolate was poured over it, melted to reveal a decadent chocolate cake topped with ice cream. The chef asked us if we were celebrating any occasion. I told him it was for my fiancé's birthday. They added a little candle to his dessert, AND he gave us the ok to take a picture together WITH our food. That truly made me very happy.\\n\\nLastly, just for kicks, a tiny 3 tier dessert with teen tiny huckleberry tarts, pumpkin cake, and caramel filled chocolates.\\n\\nAlso, I noticed some reviews mentioned how quiet it was. It's really not. After a few diners knocked back a glass of wine or 2, it gets plenty chatty. \\n\\nEverything was just lovely from beginning to end. Small talk with the chef to our silverware being constantly replaced with fresh ones after each dish. What a great experience!\\n\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve come here twice for dinner. Both times the food was absolutely superb. Hands down the best \"fancy\" restaurant in NYC right now. Highly recommend and worth every penny :)\\n',\n",
       " 'Went in December, I am late with this review, however it lived up to the hype.  Although out of the way for me, it was worth the trip into Brooklyn.  Interesting intimate setting, open kitchen. The food was absolutely outstanding.  The sommelier was knowledgable and very helpful.  The food came in a nice rhythm.  Photos were prohibited, so I cannot post anything here.  High quality in every aspect.  The tough part is the reservation.  Highly recommended\\n',\n",

       " 'I went here last year, after winning a prize for 2, and saw that it was valued at $250 (interesting when at the time it was $70pp). My gf and I had our hearts set on a cooking class, which we incorrectly assumed this was. By the end of the night, I felt her poking me whispering \"I feel like we\\'re on Top Chef.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t really remember what was served but a few standouts include: the langoustine, an oyster shooter, a fried foigras ball, and impeccable service. The BYOB was a huge plus as well but I was more impressed with Cesar and team\\'s willingness to explain and elaborate on his cooking technique. We were overjoyed at the experience and actually wanted to come back for another shot. Unfortunately, reservations were booked for the next 6 months so we eventually gave up trying. \\n\\nI recently wanted to refer a few friends but just noticed that BYOB has all but been eliminated and the price has increased to $95pp (supposedly increasing to $125-$150pp). Because of the high pricing, I feel like it will be difficult to convince friends that this is the real deal. Then again, for $125pp, why not indulge in a Chef\\'s tasting menu? \\n\\nMy suggestion: give it a whirl. You will not be disappointed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Cute little things to eat in cute little plates. I liked the experimental nature of the dining experience... but the overall meal lacked a certain cohesiveness.\\n',\n",
       " 'HOLY MOLY!!!! what a treat!!! only 18 tables but every 18 will walk away a satisfied customer. Chef Cezar Ramirez was absolutely amazing, his combination of ingredients surprised me on every dish. It was a combination of seafood (predominantly fish) and other ingredients but the combination just blew my mind, not alot of cooking alot of raw fish but damnnnnn....its realllllly good!.\\n',\n",
       " 'Excellent food.  Absolutely delicious.  That being said, you better be in the mood for fish -- about 15 of the 20ish dishes had fish in some form (most focusing on it).  The first two thirds of the meal consisted of all smaller one-bite or so dishes, which was a great way to experience numerous different flavors (way better than some lame 3 course meal at other nice restaurants).  The last third of the dishes were larger, but by no means huge.  It was the perfect amount of food for a dinner of that length.\\n\\nA few things to note:\\nBYOB -- Great, saves you some cash and lets you bring exactly what you want to drink.\\nBest seats -- Probably at the ends, since it lets you hear the descriptions (since most dishes aren\\'t on the menu, but if it is, it\\'s one word like \"turbot\" or \"cheese\") and chat with Chef Cesar a bit.\\nSubstitutions -- Not a place to be making dietary requests, as Cesar is very serious about what he does.  Saying something like \"no fish\" would get you pimp slapped and shown the door.\\nSize -- The place is small: you have to squeeze out from your chair to get around the restaurant, especially if you are seated at the end.  All of the wine and glasses are kept in the back, so you might be squeezing in and out a few times during the meal.\\nTough reservation -- Just call call call. If you ever get through, and they are already full, definitely ask to be put on the waiting list.  Cancellations definitely happen (and that\\'s how I finally got a table). Just be prepared to make the decision on a moment\\'s notice if you get offered a cancelled table weeks later.\\n\\nAll in all one of my top dinners in NYC.  Great food, many different flavors to taste, and relaxed/fun environment sitting around the cooks doing their thing.  In the fish realm, probably even better than Le Bernardin, though I ought to head back there again before making that statement for sure...\\n',\n",
       " 'Securing Friday night seats at Cesar Ramirez\\'s Chef\\'s Table at Brooklyn Fare locked in the dates I\\'d travel to New York.  My first awareness of Brooklyn Fare came when reading of New York\\'s Michelin-starred restaurants.  The phrase \"3-star BYO\" grabbed my attention.  By the time I made it back to NYC, the price had been raised & it was no longer BYO.  Despite that, I was intrigued by the concept.  Stripped down creature comforts and outstanding food--a Michelin 3 star meal at a stainless steel counter--is a unique proposition.  As I have always cared much more about food than service or atmosphere, I was excited to see this taken to an extreme.\\n\\nWe had 8-10 cold dishes, 6-8 small warm courses, a few composed plates, and a few desserts.\\n\\nDiscussing this meal in the days that followed, we consistently praised the precision and flavors showcased throughout the night.  This is clearly market- and chef-driven omakase executed at an extremely high level (plus the new Brooklyn Fare wine list was impressive).  However, while the in-the-kitchen view is a unique concept, I\\'m not sure that it is more enjoyable than a dining room setting.  Only a modest amount of cooking occurred at the time of service, so most observable activities were plating, blending, and saucing.  Considering the limited privacy due to guests\\' proximity and the engagement feels a bit like being at a party where you only know one other person.  That said, it\\'s an impressive, unique dining experience and any downside of the format is more than made up for by the quality of the food served.  Clearly of the highest quality, this meal was a great way to start our week of memorable meals.\\n\\nSnipped from my blog..food specifics here: http://fillc.blogspot.com/\\n',\n",

       " 'Best. Meal. Of. My. Life. \\nCeasar Ramirez changed the way that I will think about food. \\nForever.\\nWhen I actually told him this, he replied, \"It\\'s just food.\"\\nI have been here twice, both times with my partner and another couple. We have managed to converse easily (despite what others have said about the somewhat awkward seating) and have had amazing experiences through and through. ALL canapes are amazing - especially anything being served with Uni and yes, there will be Uni. No photography, no note taking - I only wish I could recount the details of more than a handful of the 20 canapes I had in January and the 16 I had in April. Some overlap - I believe there are 5 or so staples. \\nA word of advice...until they secure their liquor license, you can BYO. I suggest reaching out to the reservation hostess, who will put you in touch with the sommellier. She will give you recommendations so you can pair your courses. It\\'s been a lovely experience to start with champagne or something sparkling moving through at least 2-3 additional bottles. She (Michelle) will also let you know when to switch to what. (I would offer Ceasar a glass - not a bad idea to get on his good side. He is making you each of the brilliant dishes you are eating, afterall). We have ended up sharing wine with those sitting around us as well - if you\\'re comfortable with that.\\nIf you don\\'t like seafood this spot may not be for you...\\n',\n",

       " \"I am just recovering from my meal last night and can't help thinking about it. MICHELIN is smart to jump on the Chef's Table bandwagon. Sure i would think no wine list, no coat rack, and a casal environment (including the dress code) would prevent a 3 star rating. But if Food is the main thing (which Chef Cesar will tell you it is)....this place is an easy 3 star. While it's casual, don't be fooled. The Kitchen and plateware are gorgeous.....worthy of any top food place. \\n\\nThe 18 canape's that start the meal (most 1 bite courses, a few 2 bites) are all served individually. I have often tasted a few great amuse bouches wishing I could have a whole meal of them. Well thats what you get here. I would say of the 18, mostly seafood, canape's 15 were awesome, while the other 3 were only great. Almost all are Japanese style, mostly raw, Kaiseke-like, Also, the timing was perfect. One every 5 minutes, so you were never waiting.....never hungry. \\n\\nThen the main courses arrive (mostly appetizer sized, which fits perfect with the theme, and never let's the amount of food get out of hand). The meal hit on all the key foodie food groups......Uni, Caviar, Foie Gras, Black Truffle, and White Truffle. White Truffle on the Pumkin Raviolo was a surprise. Generous shavings, no supplemental charge. Delicious. \\n\\nWhether it was the piping hot Squash Soup, Uni with Black Truffle on Brioche, Flash Fried Sardine, Salmon Parfait, Black Truffle Dashi w/ Foie Gras or Lobster w/ Foie, not to mention Cavair, Potato, and Beet Puree,\\nand a stunning duck breast with Crispy skin cooked a perfect medium rare (the only meat course of the night).....the food was fantastic.\\n\\nThe last thing is Cesar Ramirez himself. He gets a bad rap for being too serious and too controlling. That said, Whatever questions I had, he answered....whether about his ingredients, other chef's/restaurants, Michelin, the kitchen.....anything. I called him Chef....he said to call him Cesar. And he will gladly take pictures with the guests after the meal. He seems like a really good guy. Also, you have to respect a 3 star Michelin chef who is cooking 5 ft from you. While Alain Ducasse, Daniel Boulud and others rarely cook in the kitchen.....this is watching a guy, who is at the top of his game, with confidence to cook right in front of his guests. \\n\\nSo, add me to the bandwagon, ..........If you love food, you must go.\\n\",\n",

       " \"The food, as discussed exhaustively by others, is extremely impressive. I was surprised by how Japanese-inflected it was - lots of raw or barely cooked seafood, etc. The chef is certainly a moody control-freak bastard - we got him on a grumpy, taciturn night, barely speaking to the customers, and near-silently dressing down his staff when they didn't execute to his satisfaction.

I mean, when a friend told me that he knew someone who ate there and had to wipe tears off his face from one of the courses, I believe him.  Chef Ramirez\\'s food is like a gorgeous and touching performance that engulfs you in it\\'s delicacy and beauty.  But it\\'s the kind of performance you make friends over as you exclaim and delight with your dining neighbors.  Drinks get shared, laughter, grins, and contented countenances ensue.

I can't tell you my favorite because first I can't pick just one but also because they don't have menus they tell you what is it and that's that. No pictures allowed but the chef is nice and talks to everyone. The food was so beautiful every detail perfectly placed and set in its desired spot. The beautiful edible flowers in most dishes was a really great touch. You can tell the chef loves to cook and really puts his all into every dish. Would absolutely return worth every penny. I would suggest the 4 glass wine pairing or they will even let you get two different kinds. The only down fall was the desserts and cheese course they were good but didn't stand up to the spectacular first 14 dishes .. the frustration of trying to get a reservation is worth it.

I was so stuffed, I felt like I was rolling out the door! Most of the starters were seafood, which was perfect - light and easing you into the main courses. The lamb and quail were exquisite, the uni was amazing (and I didn't like the uni at Ko), and even the oyster was so well-done that I enjoyed it (and I have never once enjoyed an oyster). Even the desserts were amazing - which impressed me even more - a chef with a deft hand at both the main dishes and the dessert. \\n\\nLove the BYOB (although, I had to stop because there was so much food). Cutest little service-ware. I could go on and on... \\n\\nThe only cons I could think of was the reservation system (6 weeks in advance, Monday starting at 10am only) and one deep-fried canape, that just didn't stand out like every other dish. \\n\\nAs an FYI - they charge your card ahead of time but the tip must be in cash.

       " \"Like some of the other reviewers, I have eaten at a number of other restaurants in New York with 2-3 Michelin stars and/or Zagat food ratings of 26-29. Unlike them, I do not feel that the Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare is deficient because of its service. On the contrary, my wife's and my meal at this restaurant was the best in our lives, hands down. Better than Le Bernardin, better than Daniel, better than Bouley. Absolutely. The. Best. Meal. Of. My. Life.\\n\\nThe details of the meal have been described in other reviews--multiple small bites followed by a seven course tasting menu of larger portions sparingly described on the menu you receive. I went in May and it was then (and I believe still is) BYOB, which made it all the more worthwhile. The food was not just the most flavorful and amazingly presented food I have ever had, it was inventive with flavor combinations and texture combinations that I had never had before. The presentation was stunning, with each dish and silverware piece seemingly made for that particular dish.\\n\\nIs the service the same as at Le Bernardin or Daniel? Of course not--you're essentially in the kitchen with no waitstaff. It's a completely different experience. That doesn't make it bad, or worse, just different. But the chef is wonderful and, if you treat him and his food with respect, very happy to answer questions and talk, especially as the evening goes on. Also, equally part of the experience is the communal setting and being able to talk with other diners, an experience you never get in other restaurants. Don't go for a romantic dinner for 2 where you'll feel pampered--this isn't that place. But if you want the absolute best food of your entire life, at a high but absolutely worth-it price, then this is the restaurant for you.\\n\",\n",

Chef Ramirez uses only the finest ingredients and he spares no cost in providing it to his customers. He lets the food speak for itself without overwhelming it unnecessarily. \\n\\nAs for Chef Ramirez being serious about his cooking I totally agree. He is not trying to provide a frat house atmosphere but he lets diners enjoy themselves freely. Just don't act rude or distracting to him or the other patrons and all will be good. I have witnessed some poor obnoxious behavior here. It's sad today to see how self absorbed some diners can be these day. No regard to the people around them. The company of the meal makes it that much more enjoyable. Wine geeks can share their bottles and be generous enough to offer the staff a tase because it will go along way.

       " 'I am now reading the reviews for the first time after having dined at Chef\\'s Table this week and am realizing that since I experienced it without the preconceived expectations often mentioned here that are seemingly a consequence of the tremendous effort required beforehand (I didn\\'t make the reservation, have no idea what it cost, or where we were since our driver took us), I can feel somewhat unbiased and just talk about the food, the wine, the service, and the space.\\nI was glad to be in the first seating (7pm)  and felt sorry for the second seating (I think 7:30) having to watch us eat and basically ruin any element of surprise while their dishes followed a few courses behind. As for the space itself, I rather liked sitting around a professional chef\\'s kitchen and being a part of the action. Because it is small and people are dining so close to each other, I kept thinking that this would really be amazing if we were all friends experiencing this together. Instead some couples were silent foodies, others loud and celebratory, thus making for an awkward ambiance toward which the server made no effort. Be sure to go with someone with whom you\\'re comfortable sitting in silence as we all were for the first half-hour (no first date!). The chef was very kind to personally welcome everyone with a handshake or backpat before the meal. The server, however, seemed to be trying to be so professional that she came off as cold and uptight the whole evening, which again had we not been in such an intimate setting would have been ok. The sommelier had the right balance of professionalism, making sure the guests were comfortable.\\nReading here that it used to be BYOB, I can enviously imagine it would have been fun to bring wines from our own collection and enjoy sharing with the people around us to break the ice. Alas, we had their wine pairing, which was thoughtfully selected but just OK compared to what we would have brought and liked to have paired with the food since I\\'m not much of a white wine drinker. \\nThe food was meticulously prepared and plated with precision technique (tweezers) and thankfully there are many other reviews here with detailed descriptions because without allowing pictures or imparting us with a menu, I can\\'t remember the dozens of small dishes. A few things I did notice: I usually don\\'t like scallops but they cooked it to textural perfection; uni was used in several of the dishes, but unfortunately it was not the freshest uni (and with urchin freshness is binary). I did really like that most of the menu was seafood. They used the expected high-end ingredients (caviar, truffles, etc) in delicious and masterfully prepared ways, but to be honest, I did not see the \"mind-blowing\" innovation of flavor combinations or textures that Yelpers  write about here. It was no Alinea.\\nOne other awkward moment was at the end, when there was no indication that our dinner was over. While we did not want to disturb the staff busily working on the second seating group, a quick \"thank you\" exchange with someone would have been a nice way to end the evening. Instead we just kind of walked out.\\nSo, having now dined at every three Michelin starred restaurant in New York (and many others worldwide) I would of course recommend Chef\\'s Table as a satisfactory dining experience, but I would not be in a hurry to return. I imagine it would have been a fun and fascinating find in its early days, but now with its 3 Star plaque prominently displayed on the wall, it seems to be trying to be like the others rather than embracing its intimacy and uniqueness. I hope this has been of help to some readers.\\n',\n",

I called religiously every Monday from 10:30-4pm and by the time I got through reservations would be booked for the week. I put myself on the waitlist each week but never received a call.  Finally I got through one Monday morning and totally scored.  This restaurant serves one of the best meals and everything is meticulously prepared.  The chef is extremely low key and humble.  Remembering everything I ate is impossible.  Just when you think you're done, you're not.  And then there's dessert, which is multiple courses as well.   You're not allowed to take pictures but it's the memory of the feeling you get after you tried each bite that stays.  Truly amazing.\\n\",\n",

A number of the canapes were quite good - but after we finished our canapes the chef asked to speak with my friend in order to tell her that we were being too loud - we have fun And laugh and have a good time - he suggested for a good time we should try a bar!  This made us so uncomfortable - I love food and well prepared food more than anything it is my religion I worship food - and I could not enjoy anything after this.  We stayed for uncomfortable mains with the chef always avoiding our glance and then left after dessert.  Incredibly, the chef chased us down the street to expound on our \"rudeness\" and tell us how the place was not in fact a restaurant?  We would never have returned (honestly on the weakness of the mains - despite the social shaming I really liked a number of the canpaes, but nothing interested me with the mains) but he told us not to come back and crazily continued to denigrate our manners as customers (at his non-restaurant restaurant)!

The byob also makes it easy on the wallet as top restaurants also charge top dollars for wine.  This reminds me of the old bouley for those that recalled how innovative the dishes were, which makes sense given Cesar was the executive chef there.  He cooks only a few nights a week but you can setup a special dinner for 10 on his nights off.\\n\",\n",

The lobster with the tangerine was awesome, and as I come from a long line of Maine lobster people who would be horrified by such a combination, I hope that says a lot.

You can tell everything's been thought out and fussed over. This is not a place for d-bags just looking for a place because they can afford it.  Please go to appreciate the food! The combinations were refreshing and surprising. With the chef there overseeing dinner, you do have a better connection and understanding with the food you're eating. You can tell that the chef is very meticulous and serious about what he does and he wants his customers to enjoy it.

       " 'This was the best restaurant experience that my fiance and I have ever had. We live in Seattle and were planning a trip to New York, primarily planned around eating. We had a list of places that we wanted to try, and while researching new restaurants, the Chef\\'s Table came up. We decided this would be our \"splurge\" meal while on vacation. We only had 5 nights in New York, so on the Monday morning that reservations became available for the week we would be visiting, we both called from two phones. After about 10 minutes of calling, one of us got through, and we were able to get a reservation for the Friday night that we would be there. I\\'m not sure why everyone else is having such a hard time getting a reservation, or why they are so upset about it. The experience was incredible. Friday morning of our reservation, we called the restaurant and spoke to Chef Cesar himself. He told us an idea of what we would be served that night, and his suggestions for wine. We found a great wine shop and picked up a sparkling wine and two bottles of red. From the moment we walked in the door to when we left 3 hours later, we felt the money was well worth the experience. Our first course was served within 5 minutes of sitting down, and they didn\\'t stop for 3 hours. Every single course was different than anything I have tasted or could have imagined. We drank all 3 bottles, shared wine with our fellow patrons, and chatted with the chef. Back in Seattle, we have recommended this restaurant far more times than I can remember, and hope to be back someday soon.\\n',\n",

I love uni and scallop were both very fresh.  \\n\\nThe negatives?  Way too salty for one of the worlds best restaurants.  The caviar soufflé and lobster had a lot of salt.  My biggest complaint is the saltiness of the food.  The table next to us said the same thing after trying the food so it wasn't just us.  I ended up drinking so much water and wine to try to offset the salt.  It wasn't pleasant.  Other thoughts - Pumpkin cake don't get it.  The other chocolate dessert is better.  The granola they gave us as a parting gift had tons of sugar - making it inedible unless you want to get diabetes.  \\n\\nThis is supposed to be the best restaurant in the us and I would strong disagree with that.

       " \"I came here to celebrate our anniversary, and if you had to have one takeaway from my experience... having been to Per Se just a few months ago, Per Se was a much more lux experience (with a price tag to match, unfortunately.) Eleven Madison Park feels a bit like Per Se's rebellious younger sibling - where Per Se is constrained, highbrow, and perhaps a bit pretentious for some, Eleven Madison Park has a touch of whimsy and fun. To explicate: there were these brightly colored blue and black wooden boxes on our table. The server soon explained to us that it was a partnership with an artist, to encourage us to put our phones in the box so we can dine technology-free. Our servers also had more of an amicable and casual affect than at EMP.\\n\\nAnyhow, we ordered the tasting menu with the cheaper wine pairing. For the fish, meat, and dessert courses, you were given a choice between two different options. This unfortunately led to a server mistakenly swapping our dishes. Now, it really isn't a big deal, but EMP *is* supposed to be a three Michelin star restaurant with the highest attention to detail... and that server never darkened our table after that big faux pas. I also thought the wine pairing was a little less memorable overall than what I had at Per Se, although there was a beer served with the cheese course, which, again, is apropos with that slight irreverence that I think EMP is trying to evoke.\\n\\nOne of my favorite dishes was the mushroom course. They brought out a fresh-hewn boulder of mushroom to demonstrate how much it cooks down. The mushroom was exquisite. It was savory and umami and there was extra-crisp outsides and some extra-meaty and fleshy insides. I also really enjoyed the lobster (for which the halibut was an alternative) - it was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of doneness.\\n\\nI think where EMP is outshined by Per Se is in the little accoutrements, if you will. The little amuse bouches, while creative in concept (truffle-filled dosas with broth tea, etc.) just didn't taste great. It was soggy and not as crisp as I had hoped. The bread basket offered by EMP was just... one bread. It was good, but it wasn't remarkable. As were the desserts - Per Se gives you a whole bevy of desserts with not one but two take home petit fours, while EMP just had the one main dessert entree with a peanut butter chocolate candy and some granola to take home. All of it was delicious, of course, but just not quite as... upscale? Also, nothing quite beats the spectacular view at Central Park that Per Se has.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm starting to think that there's no way to get a good deal when you're dining at the Michelin three-starred level; it seems like you truly get what you paid for.\\n\",\n",

Eleven Madison Park is a very long meal however, be prepared to sit and slowly pace through each course for 3 hours in total.\\n\\nI highly recommend that if you're already here, go for the full experience ride and opt for the wine pairing. I don't find myself usually enjoying a lot of wine nor am I a wine connoisseur by any means, but their wine pairing was absolutely GENIUS. Every glass was fantastic and paired seamlessly well with the dishes. High warning that you will leave out of here really tipsy from it too! On our seasonal tasting menu we both had dishes with black truffle components and black truffle tea, soufflé with clams and caviar, roasted oyster mushrooms, leeks, and a cheese fondue dish. Some of my highlights of the meal were the seared foie gras... so amazing and perfect especially the wine accompanying this. As a big fan of duck meat, the duck breast with honey and lavender glazed was spectacular. My boyfriend had scallop with sea urchin, halibut, and dry aged veal which were all delicious. Each dish truly had so many depths of layers in elements and flavor from top to bottom. Not a single dish that we were served fell short.\\n\\n**Ask for a kitchen tour! They gave us a fun apple cider tasting game inside the kitchen tour. The service here is so stellar and professional. Oh and you will actually leave out of here full. So make sure to go on their website a month in advance from the date you plan with a CC ready because you'll be paying the $335/pp in advance.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Eleven Madison Park is on every foodies bucket list. Is it the best restaurant in the world. Hell no. Is it amazing...yes. The flavors are those you have had before just sophisticated with accompanying service that treats you like royalty. Forget about the number one in the world factor and come enjoy an exemplary experience. Bartender is great. Crowd is sophisticated. The beef tartare with foie gras was phenomenal as was the lamb. Your taste buds will thank you.\\n',\n",
       " \"Overall: Came to celebrate life milestones with a friend . Greeted with table filled with many wrapped gifts with no explanation . Initially, I was planning on taking these gifts home; however realized that this was the first course. This was an interesting twist, however perhaps a deeper message? I'm not sure, however was not expecting to think through my meal. Gifts included caviar, broth, pickled mushrooms, ( incredibly delicious) egg and cabbage. The waiter brought out a potato pastry... again no explanation regarding what goes with what ... I was starting to feel like I was in a social experiment. I'm still not sure how I feel about the experience . \\n\\nYou pay ahead of time, tip included, so there is no tipping after your meal.\\n\\nService: we had several waiters check in on us . It made for , again, an interesting experience as there was a new person coming by every other meal. The waiters were all nice and attentive. \\n\\nFood: overall, food was delicious , but honestly nothing mind blowing or meriting 3 Michelin stars. I think the Lobster was incredible and incredibly unique. I was underwhelmed by the seared fois gras which felt overpowered by ginger taking away from the expected seared taste. \\n\\nOverall: This was a one time experience that I as okay. I don't think I would return mostly because I've had a better experience at other less rated Michelin restaurants for a much better price.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I've been lucky enough to have gone to Eleven Madison Park a couple of times in my life.  Most recently was in May 2017, just prior to the closing.  They were doing a retrospective menu of some of their best dishes.\\n\\nThe restaurant is large, with high ceilings, and large tables.  The service is excellent.\\n\\nThese were the dishes included in our tasting:\\n\\nGougeres with grated gruyere (4.5/5): Tasty little balls of dough and cheese, very rich.  Truly amazing.\\n\\nSea Urchin Cappuccino with Peekytoe Crab and Cauliflower (5/5): So excellent.  The uni cappuccino was so savory and fatty, and the crab was fresh and complemented the uni foam well.\\n\\nLittle Neck Clam Clambake with Veloute and Parker House Rolls (4/5): An assortment of clams, served in various manners.  Some of them were great, and some were all right.\\n\\nPrawn Roulade with Avocado and Yogurt (5/5): So good.  The prawns with the avocado was an excellent combination, and the yogurt added a nice tartness.\\n\\nBeet Salad with Goat Cheese and Nastrum (3.5/5): Beautifully presented, but it wasn't a standout dish.  Everything was very fresh, but it paled in comparison to many of the other dishes.\\n\\nCarrot Tartare with Rye Toast and Condiments (4/5): Once again, a beautifully-presented dish.  Carrot tartare with a number of spices, to be placed over rye toast.  I did enjoy it, but it wasn't the best dish of the night.\\n\\nTurbot, Poached Zucchini, and Squash Blossom (4/5): Turbot served with poached zucchini on top, squash blossom on the side.  The sauce was creamy and delicious, and the turbot was cooked well.  It was a very solid dish.\\n\\nWinter in Provence: Black Truffle, Celery Root, Potato, and Chevre Frais (5/5): A beautifully, wonderfully creamy, savory, rich dish.  It was really excellent.\\n\\nBass on Nettles, Creamed with Potato and Spring Garlic (3.5/5): The bass was good, well-cooked, but it wasn't particularly a standout of this meal either.\\n\\nMilk and Honey with Dehydrated Milk Foam and Bee Pollen (4.5/5): What an interesting dessert.  The texture and consistency of the dehydrated milk foam was so fascinating, and it had the right amount of sweetness to it.\\n\\nChocolate Palette with Peanut Butter and Popcorn Ice Cream (4.5/5): Another great dessert, chocolate with a lighter flavor of ice cream to mix with the richness of the peanut butter and chocolate.\\n\\nGoing to Eleven Madison Park is truly an experience, and the food was excellent as well.  I have not been back since the renovation, but I hope to return in the near future!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Brought the boyfriend here and we loved this place except for the fact that one of the servers brought us a dirty knife??? Minus one big fat star for that. I was in shock because you'd never expect that at EMP. I didn't want to cause a scene but seriously...? You didn't look at the knife before handing it to us??  This restaurant was rated number one in the freaking world in 2017 so this was disappointing. Aside from that, it was almost a perfect dining experience. \\n\\nThe duck which is aged in house is a must! Overall the whole experience took a couple of hours and we even got a tour of the kitchen at the end. It was pretty late so most of the chefs have already left for the night so next time I'd definitely want to come earlier. I opted to do the wine pairing and I felt like it was totally worth it. At the end they give you a list of everything you had and the wines you had to go with it as well so you don't have to try to memorize it.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Eating here was a spectacular experience.  While the food was truly refined and amazing it was the overall experience of Eleven Madison Park which truly puts it in a very rarified space.  It is the combination of the room, the service, the wine, and the food which makes for a truly memorable meal.\\n\\nI absolutely love the room.  It is spacious, gracious, and sophisticated.  Soaring ceilings give it the hushed feel of a museum or cathedral but at no point does it feel oppressive or constrained.  Conversation is easy and the place has the energetic buzz of people enjoying themselves and their company.  The staff does an outstanding job of setting the tone.  Service is formal and extremely well-choreographed but with a warm familiarity and ease of presentation that keeps things light and enjoyable.  Really a remarkable feat - Eleven Madison Park somehow strikes the right balance in the service to make the evening fun, pleasant, and energetic where others would probably fall into the super formal, low energy model.  For this alone I would come back often to dine here.\\n\\nBut the food is the star of the show and does not disappoint.  Amazingly refined and perfectly executed, this is classic works taken to a new, more modern level.  Throughout the meal I felt like I was being schooled in classic French technique and dishes with a uniquely modern NYC twist.  Not the mind blowing molecular gastronomy of other top echelon restaurants, this was refined, sophisticated, and somehow familiar.  Every dish we had was perfectly crafted and balanced.  Standouts for me included:\\n\\n- Potato, Leek, and Clam soufflé with Caviar - light, creamy, and the prefect balance of salty and sweet.  The hint of sweetness which came from the sugar coating on the ramekin was really amazing.\\n- Foie Gras with Pumpkin Seeds presented like a hedgehog (trust me) and was an amazing conglomeration of crunchy from the seeds and delicate foie gras silkiness.\\n- Halibut with Black Shallot and Shitake was superbly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and was one of the finest pieces of fish I've ever had.  \\n- Golden Oyster Mushroom is a large mushroom carved tableside and is eye opening.  If I didn't know better, I'd say I was eating a bacon preparation.  Definitely some magic going on with this dish.\\n\\nThe sommelier did a wonderful job with the pairing.  We went on a lovely trip through a huge variety of primarily old world bottles.  Leaning very heavily toward the silky and elegant (nary a jammy fruit bomb in the bunch, thank you) I found each glass was perfectly matched with each course.  When our dishes varied (you get several choices with the tasting menu) the pairing also changed for each diner to suit their selection.  The Sommelier's presentation struck the right balance of informational, reverent, and conversational.  Again, I cannot compliment the service enough.\\n\\nFinally, I'll end on yet another point about the service.  We were here for my wife and my 20th anniversary.  I'd had the pleasure of dining at Eleven Madison Park a couple of weeks earlier for a large business group event in one of their upstairs function rooms.  On my way out that evening I mentioned to Brian, the staff member who'd taken care of our room, that my wife and I would be back in a couple of weeks for our 20th Anniversary dinner.  When we arrived that evening she was effusively greeted and wished happy anniversary by the host.  When we were seated our server was Brian from the previous event who graciously greeted us for our anniversary as well.  Wow, what an amazing world-class touch and the service which was provided throughout the evening was similarly thoughtful and exemplary.  It was truly a unique and special experience and the perfect place to celebrate such a big event.  Can't wait for our 25th, but we'll be back way before then.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Every foodie has a foodie dream. You know, that one $$$$ restaurant that\\'s like forever on your bookmark list. Welp, mine was (you guessed it) Eleven Madison Park! I started reading/writing reviews on Yelp 7 years ago. I came across Eleven Madison Park have followed their seasonal menus ever since. This year... 7 years later, I got to experience dinner with my fiancé here and let me tell you... it was a dream come true, literally.\\n\\nWe came for the full dining experience-- 10+ courses. I have to be honest and say every dish, unfortunately, wasn\\'t 110% over-the-top amazing (which is what I was expecting). BUT every dish was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. \\n\\nThe menu changes so no need to get into every detail of each dish, but I did enjoy the black truffle \"pizza\", lobster, and oysters the most. Though the courses are pretty small, the ingredients were very rich so towards the end I literally couldn\\'t eat anymore. We had to pass on our last courses and pack our dishes to-go. We were pleasantly surprised with granola in our to-go bag and a cute and compact menu souvenir to remember all of our courses for the night. You will end the meal with a complimentary bottle of their house-made brandy which they encourage you to enjoy as much as possible. We only had room for 1 shot, but forced 2 more after.\\n\\nTIP: If I could re-do it, I would have opted for the bar side deal. This has less courses, which would probably have been fulfilling. + It\\'s wayyyy less expensive! I\\'m confident you\\'ll get a very similar experience.\\n',\n",
       " 'I knew that I had to dine at this restaurant if I had the opportunity to come back to NYC. My two lovely girlfriends and I were able to get a tasting menu during our September trip. You definitely pay the pretty penny to enjoy a meal at EMP. From the moment I walked into the restaurant and was greeted by the manager of Customer Service and the servers were very attentive. The food was phenomenal and flavor was delicious. At the end of the meal, EMP provides all their guests with a treat. \\n\\nDefinitely recommend everyone to check this restaurant out since it is a 3-Michelin starred and was voted one of the top restaurants in this world for 2018.\\n',\n",
       " 'What can I add that has not already been said about this place?\\n\\n1. It\\'s challenging to get a reservation - basically you need to set aside some time at the beginning of the month to catch a date for the following month to reserve on their website.  Miss it by a half-hour and you will likely be out of luck.\\n\\n2. They are very accommodating with regards to dietary preferences/restrictions.  You will be welcomed about 1 week ahead of your meal by the Maitre D\\' at which time you may provide requests.  I requested no pork and they made sure of it. \\n\\n3.  I had requested a mocktail pairing with the meal and they went above-and-beyond with their original crafted creations (of course, at a cost of $180 extra for 2 ppl).  Each drink absolutely complimented the course being served.\\n\\n4. The food was outstanding, however my companion did comment that the chef had a \"heavy hand\" with salt on a few of the courses.  Otherwise the food was fresh and flavorful.\\n',\n",
       " \"I ate here last week & am still dreaming about my meal you guys. I'm visiting from LA so decided to take myself out here. I will admit, I was slightly nervous dining here solo but the staff was SO welcoming & accommodating. The food was delicious, definitely the best foie gras I've ever had, the lobster tasted like butter, & the truffle dosa was to die for. In addition to that, they gave me a tour of the kitchen & then wrapped up my dinner with homemade granola. I will honestly never forget this meal & HIGHLY recommend going here, it's worth every penny,\\n\",\n",
       " \"Service is outstanding\\nFood is amazing\\nAmbience is beautiful and stunning\\n\\nIf you get the opportunity make a reservation and enjoy the best meal in all of NY!  One of the best meals I've ever had.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Verdict: Easily the best experience I have ever had at any Michelin restaurant. The service, the dedication of the staff, detail, and attention they gave me made this one of the best meals I\\'ve ever had. \\n\\nBackground: The maitre d\\' reached beforehand to clarify the occasion and dietary restrictions. I was thrilled that they offered a vegan tasting menu but I opted for the pescatarian menu instead. Jokingly, I told her I was celebrating the death of my twenties. Upon arriving at my table, there was a handmade birthday card with a picture of a tombstone that read \"RIP Ee Vonn\\'s Twenties.\" Inside the card was a list of EMP\\'s Reasons Why Life in Your 30s is Better Than Your 20s. It was incredibly sweet and thoughtful that the staff put together this personalized birthday card with an added sense of humor. It set the mood for the rest of the evening. \\n\\nWe asked for a tour of the kitchen at some point during the meal. One of the staff took us to the kitchen, explained the different stations, and got to sample some freshly brewed apple cider. The kitchen is gorgeous, organized, and bustling. It looked like a glamorous food laboratory. The executive sous chef greeted and thanked us for dining here. \\n\\nBar tasting menu - Five courses for $175 each. The husband and I shared dishes so I was able to try more items. \\n\\nCaviar (souffle with clam, leek and potato) - Souffle was soft, fluffy, and creamy. Interesting contrast between the salty, fishy caviar and the eggy texture.\\n\\nBitter Greens (with date and black tea) - The creamy date and black tea dressing at the bottom blended very well. This is the most creative salad I\\'ve seen and possibly one of the most delicious dressings I\\'ve tasted. Its sweetness balanced the bitter greens.\\n\\nBrook Trout (cured with radish, sesame, and smoked trout roe) - Fun presentation with square-shaped paper-thin slices of radish over trout over a slice of bread. It was good. \\n\\nLobster (charred with pumpkin and citrus) - Soft, warm, and savory. The pumpkin sauce was good. The lobster was wrapped in citrus peels. Who knew lobster and pumpkin made a good combination? \\n\\nStriped Bass (with turnip and brown butter) - The fish was alright but it was a palette to soak up the brown butter. The mixture of pickled and warm vegetables was a nice, crisp contrast to the fish.\\n\\nDuck (honey and lavender glazed with beets and blood pudding) - The beets were sweet. The blood pudding resembled barbecue sauce but infused with honey. The duck was juicy, soft, and savory. The skin added a delicious, salty texture. \\n\\nPear (with caramelized white chocolate) - Subtly sweet and refreshing. The balance with the soft white chocolate was great. \\n\\nChocolate (shortbread with malt and barley ice cream) - The shortbread was very good. The barley ice cream was incredible. I wanted a pint to take home. \\n\\nChocolate Covered Pretzel - Very soft, perfectly portioned layer of chocolate. Best chocolate pretzel I\\'ve ever had.\\n',\n",
       " 'We came for dinner to celebrate a birthday and really wanted to love it, but almost everything about the experience was underwhelming. \\n\\nAll the accolades aside, by any restaurant standard, this food was bland, boring, and at times, unappetizing to look at. The dosa was cold and soggy. The duck wasn\\'t particularly juicy or tender, and the skin was soggy. Lobster was cooked nicely, but lacked much flavor. Cheese fondue had an interesting table-side presentation, but was overpowered by salt and dijon mustard with the consistency of Velveeta. The best flavors were the roasted oyster mushrooms and souffle with caviar (although we all felt the spoonful of caviar alone would have been better).\\n\\nAs several other recent reviews have mentioned, there was not a single bite here that made me say wow. A lot of the food was way too salty, and almost all of the courses had a grayish color. The portions are standard tasting sizes and we often left food on our plates.\\n\\nI thought maybe I was being dramatic and sent pics to food-loving friends, drawing reactions ranging from \"that looks like an embryo of a monster\" to \"is it from the Upside Down?\". Strangest flavor of the night: Leeks with Cheddar & Parsley side dish. No exaggeration, this tasted exactly like a cold Burger King onion ring.\\n\\nThe service was also kind of strange throughout. Examples:\\n- A couple days before the reservation, the maitre d\\' reached out asking how they could make the night special. I requested a kitchen tour, which they said they \"love\" doing and would do their \"absolute best to organize\". However, the tour never happened and there was no mention of why from the staff. Totally understand that it may not have been possible, but seemed weird to not address it, especially after wasting time for both myself and their team to organize it.\\n\\n- Servers had trouble describing the dishes with lots of pauses and sometimes wrong ingredients. Was told the scallop was served with pear, but turns out it was kohlrabi & apple. The cheese in the fondue was referred to as Parmesan, but we later learned was Harbison. At one point the server said she was serving us veal with venison sauce which we remarked seemed like an interesting pairing. She then said it was venison with venison sauce which wasn\\'t on the menu. When we questioned, she said \"oh sorry, it\\'s not duck!\", which made no sense at all to the conversation. Finally, she corrected herself again declaring it to be veal with veal sauce. ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\\n\\n- During several courses, the wrong plates were served to the wrong people and the servers kept clearing the table while people were still eating.\\n\\n- When a table is reset, all the tablecloths are ironed (very conspicuously) in the dining room. This was distracting and felt pretentious.\\n\\nOverall, a very forgettable meal. Perhaps it was just an off night for the service. However, save yourself the money and wait at least until next season\\'s food menu before trying it out!\\n',\n",
       " 'Wow... \\n\\nEMP is ON POINT & then some!\\nIt definitely deserves all the hype.\\n\\nAttention to Detail.\\nExceptional Service.\\nBeautiful Restaurant.\\n\\nThe Bar Tasting Menu was PERFECT for us!\\nEverything was INCREDIBLE!\\n\\nWell worth it!\\n',\n",
       " 'One of the many Michelin *** in NYC. Overall, a satisfying experience with regards to service and food. Dishes were well executed especially the initial scallop and caviar dishes. Venison was an unexpected disappointed as it was slightly dry. For those seeking enebriation, they provide an bottle of apple brandy to finish the meal.\\n',\n",
       " \"This has been on my bucket list for a while but it was always unable to get a reservation but I finally got one for last night! I was emailed last week by one of the Maitre D's asking if I was coming in for a special occasion and I let her know that I was celebrating my run in the New York City Marathon.\\n\\nI chose the Dining Room Tasting Menu which consisted of 8 to 10 seasonal items, no alcohol. The cost was $342 after tax (gratuity is already included) Upon arrival I chose to have one glass of red wine and asked what the suggestion would be which would pair well across the board and was directed to a $27 glass of Syrah. It was perfect and quite a nice pour. I was I asked if I had any allergies or items I would prefer not to have then was told what the menu would be and was given a choice with only the appetizer, entrée and dessert. \\n\\nMy menu consisted of nine courses which arrived 5 to 10 minutes in between each one. After my second course I was surprised with a visit to the kitchen. As I shown the stations and how things work, a gentleman came by and prepared a hot cider brandy cocktail just for me. Maybe it was because of my celebration or that I was alone but this special touch was my favorite part of the evening. Back at the table I was presented with the items and an enthusiastic explanation of each. My favorite item was the tableside presentation of the black truffle mushroom tart. For the final course I was given dessert along with an entire bottle of apple brandy but unfortunately I could only manage to have a few sips. Also as a take-home gift I was given a jar of baked granola and a small tin with my personalized menu.\\n\\nThe attentiveness and kindness of the staff is otherworldly! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with an open mind about food who is looking to indulge themselves or someone else.\\n\",\n",

I've never felt so at ease yet cared for at such a fancy meal. \\n\\nThe meal started with selecting the various entrees for the night. Everything sounded delicious and I wish I could have it all. \\n\\nClam leek souffle with caviar - Tastes like a clam chowder but with clam and leek flavor really at the forefront. One of the more unique dishes I've had in recent times and certainly raised the bar. \\n\\nRoasted oyster consume - slightly salty. \\noyster butter paired well with the flaky bread. Dinner roll with a croissant like consistency. \\n\\nOyster plate - one hot, one cold option . The cold one was very limey. very contrasting experience temperature wise cause I didn't expect it. \\n\\nFoie gras, apple crisp - pan seared foie gras is usually super rich, but in this case the Apple balanced out the foie gras very nicely. Not too heavy. Good flavor\\n\\nLobster, wrapped in pumpkin and hummus sauce - fresh Maine lobster.  loved how the pumpkin is wrapped around the lobster to make it look like a tail. Incredibly creative!\\n\\nCheddar truffle crepe with truffle shavings. - this was unique and absolutely fantastic. \\n\\nDuck breast - 2 week dry aged. \\nSchezuan Peppercorns, lavender honey, Pickled beets. \\nDuck breast was more flavorful with the cab wine. interesting play on duck cause of the peppercorns, which is usually found in Chinese cuisine. \\n\\nBrussel sprouts and fish - side with the duck \\nEgg with kale - side with the duck\\nBoth sides were delicious but overshadowed by the duck. \\n\\nHoney nut squash - cheesy and sweet squash. Cheese smelled a little intense but the taste was fairly subdued. \\n\\nChocolate barley malt - a pleasant dessert. \\n\\napple brandy - specially distilled from St. Georges in Alameda. drink as much as you want. \\n\\nIn total, the entire ordeal was 3.5 hours, but it felt like it passed by so quickly. As a parting gift, they gave us homemade granola and a clever custom menu. The granola I ate for breakfast and it was delicious even days later. \\n\\nTip: My friend and I split a glass of wine, which was fantastic bang for the buck cause we just wanted a taste and not the entire pairing.\\n\",\n",

But is it?\\n\\nExperience warned me that it's hard to live up to such high praise and expectations. Still, on September 1, 2018, I jumped on Tock and prepaid $685.91 for a weeknight dinner for 2 at Eleven Madison Park.\\n\\nA week before our dinner, I received an email from Claire, one of the maitre d's asking if we were celebrating anything. This was a glimpse of the attentive service we were about to receive.\\n\\nFor those who like surprises, Eleven Madison Park is perfect because you have no idea what you're going to eat until you get there. After sitting down, the server went over the menu briefly and offered us options for some of the courses (in those cases, he and I ordered different items so that we could try more things).\\n\\nWe were also handed a box to put away our phones. Although not required, it seemed strongly suggested. I looked around the room and didnt see anyone else with their phones so I reluctantly placed mine in the box.\\n\\nThe rest of the meal was pretty much a blur. I remember not being wowed by any one dish. Several were too salty. The dining room felt sterile and uninviting. I wish I had more to say but I couldn't take photos of the dishes and I honestly don't remember the details.\\n\\nThe overall feeling was that it was not worth the hype. In New York, we ate everything from $2 pizza to Eleven Madison Park and this meal was at best average out of our meals over 4 days.\\n\\nThe parting gifts were my favorite part. We were handed freshly printed individualized menus in a mini tin can. We also received large containers of granola, which he happily snacked on over the next couple of weeks. And because we behaved so well and put away our phones, we received 2 chocolate bars to go. Let me tell you; those were some great chocolates.

Some times some dishes are a piece of art, they were not as much here.\\nWe chose the prefix menu but the menu is not there. Basically you won't know what is coming, not my cup of tea. We almost missed the last two dishes because we were too full. I think in a Michelin restaurant the chef should have a reasonable understanding of average person portion intakes and spread it over the courses. The ambiance is ok. The restaurant looks like a big hotel lobby. Still very nice and great experience but with the same money you can have two Michelin star experiences instead of one.\\n\",\n",

When we arrived we apologized and they didn't even bat an eye.  And told us that it's great that we made it! \\n\\nOnto the meal!  The food was spectacular.  Equal parts art and delicious.  The caviar was definitely out of this world.  The flavors all came together beautifully like the harmonies in a symphony.  \\nThe foie gras was also heavenly- the flavors all enveloped the senses and man I just couldn't get enough.  The crab cake underneath the bed of squash - wow they take so much care to make sure each piece is cooked perfectly and exactly the same size.\\n\\nThe 140 days dry aged ribeye was also ridiculousness.

Honestly, I'd give that to Alinea (which is now down to #34 in the world, #5 in the country), but according to the experts, this is the BEST. It's truly interesting to me how various restaurants get scored. It was indeed a solid and interesting meal with beyond excellent service.\\n\\nI suggest watching the documentary on Eleven Madison Park before going so you can truly build an appreciation all that goes into this restaurant. The Restaurateur on Netflix, do it.\\n\\nThe entire meal was solid and some dishes were very good! I can't say a single dish blew me completely away though. However highlights of the meal for me were Snails with morels & ramps, the Goat Cheese variations and the Chocolate pretzels at the end of the meal. Plus they gave us granola to go in an adorable glass container. So nice and considerate to have a little parting gift for us! They also gave my friend a chocolate bar for his birthday, love the little touches.\\n\\nI'm incredibly glad I experienced this restaurant but for me personally, it's a one and done type of experience. For $315, I'd rather do Alinea again and again.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Eleven Madison Park:\\nFavorite:\\n1: Mushroom Tart with Black Truffle and Thyme\\n2: Foie Gras Marinated with Pear and Mushroom\\n3: Duck Confit\\n4: Honeynut Squash with Cheddar\\n5: Bread for free\\n',\n",
       " 'After coming to Eleven Madison Park, people have asked me, \"Is it really that good and (if so) why?\"  I have never been able to give a simple short answer to follow my \"Yes it is that good.\"  The reason being..... From the moment I walked in til the moment I left, everything was perfect.\\n\\nSo a little back-story....  about two-three months before my trip to New York, I booked a reservation about 2-3 months in advance and let them know this dinner was for celebrating my parent\\'s 50th wedding anniversary. \\n\\nCut to the dinner- The moment we walked in the door, the hostess was very pleasant and engaging with us. She seamlessly broke into a conversation with my parents and asking them how their anniversary had been so far and if they were having a pleasant trip to New York.  I knew right away that they were trying to make my parents feel as special as possible on this day, and I really appreciated it. \\n\\nAfter bringing us to the table, we were introduced to our servers who were equally as conversational and friendly the entire meal. While I am sure they had countless other responsibilities to attend to, we never felt rushed. We even noticed that we never heard clanking plates or shoes as the staff moved about. They moved with such fluid ease that you would have though they were in a dance. But it was also very subtle, you would not notice it unless you were really watching them. And there in lies the beauty of Eleven Madison. They removed all distractions and keep us focused on enjoying everything at our table. \\n\\nAs for the food, every dish was delicious and well-presented. Throughout the meal my parents keep saying \"this is the best meal of our lives\" and which made me so happy to hear. Towards the end of the meal we were able to tour the kitchen and even there , while everyone was busy, they all just seemed to be flowing seamlessly through their tasks. \\n\\nThere is nothing I would have changed about my dining experience at Eleven Madison. I enjoyed every moment.\\n',\n",
       " \"Wtf this place was good. The service was PHENOMENAL. The food was amazing! Just don't think about the price. The wine pairing is a must do. The somms do a great job of pairing and it's overall an amazing experience. Questioning whether or not I should just come here every time I come to New York or not.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I celebrated my boyfriends birthday here. It was an amazing experience and completely worth the money spent. It is 3 hours long where you are welcomed with genuine enthusiasm and treated to a great culinary journey. The staff are well trained, amicable, enthusiastic about their job and truly there to make this an all rounded experience. It is not just about the food that makes this place stand out, and that's why the five stars. I cannot wait to go back. There's no point talking about food here cos with 3 Michelin stars it's all the same- great quality and taste that is to be expected with this caliber. The service is what MAKES the DIFFERENCE and is why eleven Madison park is amongst the top 5 restaurants in the world. Again, shout out to the staff - you guys really are appreciated.\\n\\nI'm only sad that my boyfriend left the very nice jars of muesli in the Uber ride home. It's been on my mind for days. It would have been such a great souvenir for an amazing time at this restaurant.\\n\",\n",
       " \"After months of waiting for this special dinner reservation in NYC, it was a huge disappointment! I was expecting more choice in the food menu and the type of produce used. It was great they sourced locally grown produce. The experience to finish plating the food at the table was a nice touch but didn't really add value of the taste.\\nExcellent service! However, I loved the personalized menu and goodie bag with their signature muesli/granola mix! Not value for money as other five star dining places offer better menu choices.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Will caveat by saying this is my first 3 star ever, but I was seriously impressed. Thought the entire experience was beautifully orchestrated and indeed all it\\'s cracked up to be. Well-deserving of its accolades.\\n\\nI went with a group of coworkers on a Thursday evening - can\\'t speak to the reservation process, as my colleague handled that. The restaurant itself had high ceilings, plenty of room, and was well-spaced out; decor was minimalistic and elegant (not flashy); atmosphere not too loud but not stuffily hush-hush/quiet either. We surprisingly never felt like we were being too rowdy in our conversations (and we each had more than our fair share of drinks that evening, so we weren\\'t necessarily what I\\'d call the most \"well-behaved patrons\"). Midway through the meal though, there did seem to be a wintry draft coming in from somewhere...so that wasn\\'t pleasant. But otherwise, a pretty and upscale vibe, if not anything extraordinary (I think they were purposefully trying to be more subtle though).\\n\\n10 courses -\\xa0several of which you had options to pick from (and they send you home with a cute folding customized menu of what you feasted on + a glass jar of delicious granola for breakfast the next day!). I won\\'t list out every course, because the surprise is part of the fun! Highlights: an amazingly unique and aromatic black truffle tea + take on dosas + tuffle potato salad, foie gras seared with beet, golden oyster mushroom (mesmerizingly prepared at the table), and the captivating preparation/presentation of a Harbison cheese fondue (though this ultimately tasted too rich/salty for me, personally). A couple of my coworkers got the wine pairings and seemed to love them. I opted for two cocktails - both of which were delicious and well-made, down to the perfectly-cut ice cube. \\n\\nWhat really sold me was the service though - attentive, but not intrusive; polite, but also charming and witty (didn\\'t feel overly formal or pretentious); all-around friendly. It kind of amazed me that the servers were responsible for multiple tables, yet seemed to always have an ear out for what we were talking about as related to the food (they\\'d pipe up to answer questions we were pondering, seemingly magically appear at just the right times to push in your chair, etc.). And I know it\\'s taken for granted that they should be well-trained on all of this (and that I may be impressed just because I\\'m not as experienced with restaurants of this caliber), but it amazed me the level of detail they brought to the \"performance\" - knew whose coats were whose at the end of the meal, which of the food/drink options each person liked, etc..\\n\\nAll in all, a thoroughly impressive and enjoyable experience and one that I will certainly remember. I\\'m glad that 11MP was my first foray into the 3-star world and look forward to another occasion to come again.\\n',\n",
       " \"Most expensive/high class restaurant i've been to! The food was an 11 course meal so it was quite fulfilling. The service was exceptional and meticulous and so attentive. Every time we finished a course, they would come after an acceptable time to rotate the silverware and clean off the tablecloth for the next dish. The food itself was good, but nothing exceptional. I loved the playing of the food and the running theme of wooden and simple presentation. As for my favorite dishes, was definitely the appetizer with cream cheese. However, the rest of the courses were all quite heavy and hard to finish, especially the cheese dish. The halibut was great, the fish was so light and soaked up the sauce flavor. I loved the roasted duck, it was very fatty and had a bit of crunch on it. However, the rest of the courses focused one dimensional flavors that were heavily savory or acidic. The desserts were also very heavy aswell, i enjoyed the chocolate however it was very subpar. Overall, an amazing experience and the food was always a presentation!\\n\",\n",
       " \"As a former best restaurant in the world winner, expectations were running high. EMP has been on my list of places to visit for almost a decade. It was on my radar before it rose from a two to three star Michelin restaurant, but now it's kind of a big deal in the restaurant world. I decided to take my fiancee for our three year anniversary, but I've also been hearing mixed reviews on their most recent tasting menu and decided to opt for the abbreviated bar tasting menu instead on our most recent visit to NYC - that would later be a regretful decision.\\n\\nWe arrived a couple minutes early for our reservation, but were quickly seated at a large private table near the bar. The bar seating is tucked away in the back and a much darker area compared to the brightly lit main dining hall. Our first course was already awaiting to be opened in front of us with a box that held two black and white cookies (if you don't know what these are, they're synonymous with NYC and everywhere in the city). Except, the twist was that the black and white cookie was a cheese cookie with cheddar and apple filling. \\n\\nOur next course was my favorite of the evening: the caviar Benedict with corn and smoked sturgeon. It literally tasted like an amazing deconstructed Benedict, served in a caviar tin with bread. It was beautifully presented, but even more important, so flavorful with every scoop and bite. The menu started diverging with choices of a few courses. We tried both the foie gras and the crab next. The foie gras was marinated with eggplant and mint and was very rich in flavor. In contrast, the crab dish was presented with a salad of zucchini and lemon and was elegantly plated like everything else, but the flavor was very light and refreshing.\\n\\nThe fourth course was the lobster, grilled with greens and bean ecrasse. Having recently traveled from New England, we had eaten three lobster rolls in two days and were pretty lobstered out. But this lobster was simply cooked to perfection and arguably better than the fresh lobster rolls we were eating in Maine, which was mind-blowing to me. There were only three small morsels, but each was packed with flavor.\\n\\nThe main courses consisted of a dry aged beef and grilled with peppers and an aged duck, honey and lavender glazed with blueberries and onion. Of the two, the beef was the winner and my second favorite dish of the meal. By itself, the beef was good, but eaten with the peppers took it to another level. Something as simple as this was made so well was quite impressive. The duck was a little on the tough side for my liking, but the flavors were great nonetheless.\\n\\nFor dessert, we chose a cheese course with a triple creme in brioche with cherry and basil creme fraiche, which again had so many flavors between the sweet cherry and the creamy cheese within the brioche. For the other, we chose the blackberry ice cream and granita with caramelized milk and lemon. The presentation was very minimalist, but it was quite tasty. Dinner ended with a delicious chocolate covered peanut butter pretzel served with brandy.\\n\\nAs a bonus, I requested to tour the kitchen as I wouldn't know the next time I would be back. It's definitely not guaranteed as they had to work a few things out, but we were treated to a short viewing to the new, renovated kitchen. The kitchen didn't look like a typical restaurant kitchen, instead reminiscent of an immaculate lab with so many moving pieces working in perfect synchrony. As a parting gift, we were given a very nice glass jar of granola to have for breakfast the next day (which was amazing as well).\\n\\nThe bar tasting dinner lasted around 2.5 hours so I can't imagine how long the typical tasting would take. Booking is through Tock months in advance and cost $175, gratuity and tax included, which is quite a good price given a 3 star Michelin and consistently in the top 5 Best Restaurants in the World rankings. I would definitely return to try the full tasting menu next time and highly recommend coming here.\\n\",\n",
       " 'If there is an American summit for fine dining, Eleven Madison Park is Mt. Everest. The cuisine soars with creativity, freshness, and attention to detail. Plating is perfected, service is whisper-quiet efficient, but I never felt the least bit of pretension. It manages its Michelin status with grace: the expert and the novice are welcomed warmly alike. \\n\\nI cannot describe my experience here as anything other than art. I lack the precision of a Cordon Bleu chef to qualitatively describe the mixture of taste and texture, but I can tell you that each course was a treat for the senses, even if I did not particularly love a particular dish that much. If that surprises you, think of EMP this way: it\\'s a bit like slowly passing through a gallery of fine paintings. You recognize each one as art, you  appreciate the technique and composition, but not every paining will grab you the same way. But you will be in love with the overall experience.  \\n\\nWhat you realize is that your palate is a canvas for the kitchen to paint on - so have fun! They are counting on it. Ask yourself questions as you go along: \"How does the creamy egg texture work with this,\" or \"does this dish pair better with this wine or another.\" Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll have enough fun tasting all of it to make some great memories. \\n\\nSome tips: Do some homework and research the menu. The staff will work with your party so that preferences can be accommodated. Never be afraid to ask questions -- the staff delights in sharing their passion for the meal with you!  While you may be tempted to wear something stylish, remember that you\\'ll be seated for hours, so don\\'t neglect comfort. The wine list is daunting. Again, ask. And there\\'s nothing wrong with paying the corkage fee and bringing your own.\\n\\nThank you Eleven Madison Park, and I hope to visit again soon.\\n',\n",
       " \"I was so excited to try Eleven Madison and was honestly shocked by the food - which was way too salty. I normally prefer less salt, so assumed it was me, but then others at the table agreed. We were not even able (or willing) to eat the cheese course and declined another option as we were so turned off by the previous courses. At one point I turned to my husband and asked if we were getting punk'd - hoping we would be presented with another experience that actually lived up to the reviews and reputation. The best part of the dinner was the take-home granola and chocolate bars for putting our phones away (which was also a little weird bc we don't keep our phones out anyway, but figured we'd go with it). \\n\\nThe staff were very warm and welcoming, but there was way too many people per table. I get the attention to detail and service standards, but this felt over-the-top. The best part of the experience was prior to our visit. They restaurant connected us before and were very helpful in ensuring our allergy/food concerns were met and this was followed-through during our restaurant experience.\\n\\nI hope this was an off night, but our experience seems to match some of the other 2-star reviews. What a bummer!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Came during their summer menu, waited for months to find the right words to describe this experience. It went from three stars to five stars after many considerations.\\n\\nFirst of all, it was a great show. From the kitchen to the dinning hall, everyone was preforming to give you one of the best experiences you could have. \\n\\nSecond, let the connoisseurs do their job. For average customers who reserved online months ago, you already paid, please just sit down and enjoy the several hours of your life.\\n\\nFinally, it offers more than just food. The taste is only part of the reasons that they once was the no.1 restaurant in the world. If you want better tastes, go to Maido, go to Francesca; if you want exotic food, go to White Rabbit, go to Central; If you want creativity, try Alinea. But if you want to have a great time, forget about their no.1 halo, just enjoy and take better pics for Instagram.\\n\\nPlus, don\\'t turn your plates over to see if their logo facing u directly before eating, like what \"7 Days Out\" on Netflix suggests.

       " \"I held off on writing this review for 2 months because I could not find the words to describe my experience at Eleven Madison. I'm still having a hard time :P We came here a few days after dining at Le Bernardin, where we had a fantastic meal comprised of our favorite food: seafood. We came in with no expectations because we didn't think this meal could be that much better than Le Bernardin. Boy, was I wrong! On a scale of 1-10, this place is 100. From the wonderful service to the exquisite food, everything was pure perfection. \\n\\nWe had 10pm reservations, but we were running about 20 minutes late. I thought for sure we blew it because we'd be rushed and the food wouldn't be as good. Nope. At no point were we rushed by any of the staff. In fact, our server asked if we wanted to tour the kitchen before our dining experience came to and end. How fantastic???\\n\\nEach dish was so beautiful and the flavors took us on an adventure. There are times where I'm disappointed in dishes on a tasting menu, but Eleven Madison blew my mind with each one. Everything was absolute PERFECTION, I tell ya. We opted for the wine pairing which was the best EVER! I didn't think any pairing could beat Benu's, but Eleven Madison takes the cake. Our Advanced Sommelier, Sam, was so great in explaining each wine and how they will pair with each dish. He was also incredibly kind and friendly. Ryan and I are rooting for you, Sam! Hope you are a Master Sommelier when we see you next :)\\n\\nIf you are hesitant about dining here because of the price, get over it! It's honestly worth every penny.

It\\'s not a cheap meal, but for someplace ranked this highly - why not for a special occasion?\\n\\nWe were greeted warmly and there was a very slight mishap but nothing major. The space is pretty nice and a bit different from other Michelin star places I\\'ve eaten at given how open it is. It\\'s not so much different from other places I\\'ve eaten at though elsewhere. It\\'s a beautiful space, but nothing to be in awe of. They do have a nice option of putting your cell phones in a box for the duration of the meal which is great. You get rewarded with chocolate at the end.\\n\\nOverall, there were some definite hits and some misses with the meal.\\n* Caviar souffle with clam, leek, and potato: Very good with an entire spoonful of caviar. Good way to start off a meal.\\n\\n* Oysters - Hot and cold with oyster butter and broth, as well as bread with butter with oyster: The oyster broth was very good and comforting and I really liked the bread. The oysters were pretty good too.\\n\\n* Foie gras marinated with pear and mushroom: Very good.\\n\\n* Brook trout cured with radish, sesame and smoked trout roe: I honestly don\\'t remember other than it was good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n* Halibut with fennel and egg: Pretty good and well executed\\n\\n* Lobster charred with pumpkin and citrus: The pumpkin overpowered the lobster and I think this was a miss. My fiance remarked to me that growing up in China, she had crab and pumpkin soup a bit and she was surprised they used lobster instead. She agreed it was a miss and told me her mom could definitely make a better pumpkin + seafood soup than this and was still surprised they weren\\'t using crab.\\n\\n* Mushroom tart with black truffle and thyme: The whole cheese black truffle sauce on the crisp with black truffle was great - funny since we had something very similar at a restaurant nearby a few days before. They were both very similar in taste, though I\\'d give the edge to this one. This also included 2 mushrooms in a little bit of broth. They were good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n* Venison - grilled with black trumpet and chestnut: Good flavor, solidly executed, but nothing amazing.\\n\\n* Duck - honey and lavender glazed with beets and blood pudding: We thought the beets and blood pudding were good. The duck I thought was very well executed.\\n\\n* Brussel sprouts (with rosemary and garlic) and kale (with pearl onions and pickled egg yolk): The kale was decent but nothing to write home about. The brussel sprouts were very oversalted and we couldn\\'t finish them.\\n\\n* Honeynut Squash with cheddar and pretzel: Really liked this and might have been one of my favorite things of the night.\\n\\n* Pear with carmelized white chocolate (ice cream): Very good. I want pear ice cream now.\\n\\n* Chocolate shortbread with malt and barley ice cream: I think this was OK - well executed from a technical standpoint but the whole flavor I thought was average.\\n\\n* Chocolate covered pretzel: Tasted like something I could buy in a regular retail store. They served apple brandy with this.\\n\\n* Traditional tea service: Some oolong tea from Taiwan. They said \"traditional tea service\" which my fiance (who is from China) said \"whatever the hell that means..\" It was nice though, but the tea was not that good.\\n\\nOverall I thought the service was very good, but not perfect by any means. We ordered some wine and my fiance\\'s glass was the last of the bottle. The waiter said he would come back with more, but never did. We never said anything because wanted to see what would happen. Maybe a little unfair, but for a 3 michelin star place, I\\'d expect them to remember. I also asked to see a bottle of wine and that never came either. Otherwise, it was great service.\\n\\nWith that being said..\\n* Did I feel like I was eating at one of the top 5 restaurants in the world? No\\n\\n* Do I feel like it was worth the money? No\\n\\n* Would I eat here again? Probably not.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, the meal was good, just not the best meal of my life good. It was not even the best Michelin starred restaurant I\\'ve had. Michelin stars are great, but only mean so much - I\\'ve had better food down some random alleyways in Asia than at some other places. Nice designations, but you have to deliver unless you\\'re just delivering to people who have never eaten their way around the world.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it was worth nearly $800 for 2 people with just a few drinks. None of the dishes will really have me craving them again or thinking in a year about any of the dishes.\\n',\n",

I had higher expectations and was very disappointed. The scallops tasted and smelled incredibly fishy. I unfortunately could not eat it. They brought out the beet salad as replacement and it was SO DRY. I wanted to scream from disappointment. They brought out a potato suffle with caviar which was delicious however you can tell they reheated the potato suffle because it was warm in some parts and cold in other bites. I wish they were more careful especially if they're going to reheat something..\\n\\n\\nThe veal and duck were spectacular...definitely no complaints there. Their brioche bread pudding had a cheese sauce that really throws you off. I did not like. The dish seemed confused it didn't know if it needed to be a sweet or savory dish.

They don't expect and actually don't accept gratuities, as they said .. it's all included! \\nLOCATION: it is in front of Madison Square Park, corner of 24th street, at the base of the historic Art Deco Building.

Food presentation is simple , delicately designed . Tastes is absolutely interesting, delicious, unique to your tastebuds as you experience the combination of flavors and ingredients you've never imagined would work.

Everything was well done and cooked beautifully -but the tasting menu lost a lot of the experimentation with flavors and creativity it had last year.

I used my birthday wish this year to finally savor the splendor they keep reminiscing about. And now, I can\\'t stop talking about it either!\\n\\nFrom ambiance with the high ceilings and comfortable dining, to the choreographed service and the delicious food--the evening was a masterpiece! So glad we arrived early to enjoy the daylight shining thru from the park that subtly came to a romantic end. It\\'s like sitting in your own art gallery, everywhere you look is a feast for the eyes--on the walls, on the floor, and on your plate! When you arrive, the revolving doors put you in this bright airy space. Ascend the steps to an elevated dining area surrounded by a gorgeous metal piece that reminds me of cornstalks. Hanging high on the far wall is a beautiful blue artwork (Rita Ackermann), on the upper right wall are darkened mirrors/windows that dances with the sunset. The seating was comfortable and inviting despite the vastness of the room. \\n\\nEvery course presented was an art piece. The flavors burst in my mouth like a little celebration with each bite. It was inventive, light and left me craving more. The flavors did not overpower one another. The wine and cocktails paired beautifully. It was a beautiful symphony. The staff were personable and attentive. Chef Humm came out to greet the diners and sheepishly came to our table as one of my friends excitedly gestured him our way. He graciously took a few photos with us and did not seemed rushed at all despite it being a full house at dinner service.\\n\\nBilly, the GM, was amazing. We noticed thru the dark windows there were rooms in the upper levels. When we inquired about it, he did not hesitate to take us around. He was warm and friendly. It was wonderful to have him excitedly showing us around his home and proudly telling us about the history of EMP. Ask to see the Sol LeWitt room. \\n\\nSadly, all things come to an end. When you leave your enchanted evening, notice the black step as you depart: it\\'s ground down equipment from the original kitchen (Daniel Turner). But wait! It DOESN\\'T END when you leave. How can I not mention Humm\\'s takeaway gift of subtly sweet and crunchy granola that tastes like \"something this good shouldn\\'t be good for me, but it\\'s granola so it must be?\" Hubby foolishly left his on the counter a day too long and within my reach and so I helpfully finished it for him.\\n\\nOne of the things that struck me about Chef Humm is his quiet unassuming humility: in his presence, his food and his restaurant. I mean, he lets you step on ART for goodness sake! There isn\\'t a giant plaque besides these pieces either, but the art are so beautiful you can\\'t help but notice them and ask more about them. I\\'m sure there were more surprises I failed to mention, but that leaves an excuse to return for another trip! It is on my list of favorites!

I think each dish was delicious, but I am just not a fan of fine dining at this point in my life - the meal took 2 hours too long, and each dish was merely a bite or two before you were done, sitting around waiting for the next dish. I found myself hungry, and not able to pig out because there just was not enough food. At the end of the meal, I was ok - not starving, not hungry but I could still eat. Nothing was bad, but I also don't have enough fine dining experience to compare eleven Madison to so I'll just have to say it was aok. I would spend my money elsewhere, wiser. Nothing against the food nor the service but if you are like me, once is enough.\\n\",\n",
       " \"More warmth needed in both decor and food presentation. A bit stark and soulless. It is obvious that the chef has made a conscious effort in presenting good food without being stuffy, however the volume has been turned down too low in terms of artistic flare which leaves one feeling underwhelmed. Nothing special. White plain tableware, white table clothes, grey toned color scheme interior with a commercial feel, even the food itself was monochromatic. \\nAs a New Yorker I appreciate the effort in putting forth the culture of big business, but when all wait staff are wearing grey business suits, it is a bit heavy handed and akin to walking into a French restaurant where all staff wear berets. \\nManagement needs to take into better consideration that going out to a restaurant - no matter what the occasion, is a much needed respite in everyone's day. This felt like I never left the office.\\n\",\n",
       " \"You have to book this place a month in advance. Then you choose a meal and prepay for it. Then the reservation can only be transferred, not canceled. We got the dining room tasting menu, which was about $350pp. Nevertheless, we were super eager to try this place! One of the best restaurants in the world...\\n\\nWe were promptly greeted and had our coats checked in. Since we had to wait a bit for our table, the manager seated us and comped a drink for me and my guest. That was definitely nice of them. Of course, it is what you are expecting at a 3-Michelin star restaurant. The service was definitely impeccable.\\n\\nAs for the food, the presentation did not awe me as other Michelin star restaurants did. For that, I took away a star. Don't get me wrong but everything was elaborately chopped, cut, and executed. However, even the fanciest ingredients like lobster was covered up or wrapped. It just wasn't as appetizing to me. They had a couple of outstanding dishes though. My favorite dish was the truffle. I could eat that all day long! Next was the oatmeal gift that they give you to bring home. Best oatmeal I've ever had! Then I would say the foie gras.\\n\\nOverall, a great dining experience. They didn't really do anything special for our anniversary. Maybe because we got the last reservation and they've already comped our drinks? Overall, definitely great to try once. Checked that off our bucket list!\\n\",\n",
       " 'A somewhat belated review of a truly memorable lunch experience in March.  This restaurant has been on my bucket list for a while, but every time I came to New York, I couldn\\'t manage to get a table.  When I knew I would be coming for a conference, I booked a table for lunch, the only time available for my dates, months in advance.  I started calling all my NYC crew but no one was available to join me.  I cast my net further afield to Philly and Boston and one of my Boston friends answered the gastronomic call.  He had to take a bus and come in just for the day, but proclaimed it totally worth it.\\n\\nWith three Michelin stars, and the title of the \"Best Restaurant in the World\", there was a lot of expectation going in to the Sunday lunch... \\n\\nOn arrival, we were ushered into a cathedral-like space with soaring ceilings and an austere but welcoming Art Deco décor, mostly whites with touches of blue, including a truly spectacular large abstract painting on the far wall.  Seated in a cozy corner banquet, we were greeted like we were a combination of royalty and long lost friends by our servers.  The cocktail menu had several unusual combinations, I opted for one containing gin and horseradish among several other things.  After a few sips, I actually felt sad, as I knew I would never have another cocktail as good as this one.  It was everything I ever wanted in a cocktail and more.  The cocktail by which all other cocktails will be forever judged and found wanting.  \\n\\nOn the pristine white tablecloth, there was an intriguing white box tied with string.  I assumed it would a parting gift to be taken home, but yay! we were allowed to open it right away.  Inside were two small savory black and white cheese cookies.  A delightful bite to kick off the meal. \\n\\nOur first course was the scallop, which was served raw with sea urchin.  Delightful and fresh.  The next dish was incredibly intricate and really showed off the subtle skills of the chef, the caviar with smoked ham and hollandaise, a sort of deconstructed eggs benedict.  There was a lot going on with this dish but it all came together in a very sophisticated way.  \\n\\nThere were multiple other courses, which I could go on about for great length, but one does run out of superlatives after a while. I do need to note the mushroom tart which was another beautifully presented and complex dish, and the duck, glazed with honey and lavender.  \\n\\nWe were offered a choice of three desserts, and each chose one, but then they brought us one of each so we got to try them all. Last on offer was a chocolate covered pretzel, brought with a bottle of apple brandy.  We were invited to have as much brandy as we wanted.  Alas, after that cocktail (did I mention the cocktails are really good?) and a few excellent wines by the glass, we only managed a few sips of the brandy, with having to navigate LaGuardia airport in just a few short hours.  \\n\\nAnd there was a parting gift!  A glass container of granola to have for breakfast the following morning (which I did, and it was amazing).\\n\\nDid it live up to the hype?  Definitely.  Was it the best meal I have ever had?  Certainly I would say this was the most flawless meal in terms of presentation, quality and service I have experienced.  Literally I cannot find anything to nit pick.  The bathrooms were a little boring maybe?  I would rate this as one of the top five dining experiences ever and it will certainly always be a memorable meal.  \\n\\nI can\\'t wait to come back for dinner.  Bring on the apple brandy.\\n',\n",
       " \"Had an incredible experience here! We came for a late night reservation and were seated right away in a booth on the floor. We did the 10 course menu that started with a cute box of black and white cookies. They put a twist on it with a slightly tart and tangy flavor added and was a nice way to start off the meal. It continued with a summer tomato theme with these dosas and a selection of dipping sauces and a tomato tea. It was all very unique and savory. This followed with a bowl of tiny tomatoes. I'm usually not a huge fan of whole tomatoes but this was cooked in a way that the flavor wasn't too overpowering. For the third course, they pushed out a tray with delicate corn soufflé and plated the dish table side and added caviar on top and bonito cream on the side. I loved how it was slightly sweet and creamy from the corn but salty from the caviar and bonito.\\n\\nThe next course we could choose and I went with the foie gras seared and it was absolutely amazing. Again, the flavor was very subtle but rich and nicely charred. The next appetizer was lobster wrapped in a thin leaf while my boyfriend got the sea bass. Immediately following was the snails course which was a lot of fun. They pushed in a cart with a grill to continue cooking the snails kebab right in front of you. When it was done, you wrapped it in lettuce and can add 4 different types of sauces. I really liked this one! I love escargots and this was done in such a creative and delicious way. They also came out with this complimentary bread with the most amazing butter that they offered to refill if you wanted. \\n\\nThe mains took a while to come out - I got the duck and my boyfriend got the steak. It came with two sides to share - a creamed corn and zucchini that were great on their own as well! Even with all the small portion sizes, we were getting pretty full by this point. \\n\\nThe dessert courses started with this creme filled brioche that came with two savory dipping sauces. We then both chose to get the chocolate sherbet desserts which were perfect! Finally, they ended up giving out this tier with two pretzels and a bottle of brandy, which you could finish if you wanted to but that bottle was very, very strong - I could only take one sip. \\n\\nTo top off the amazing experience, they gave us two goody bags with jars of granola and the menu in those cute case! Overall a really well done and delicious meal.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Ok, if this was just another regular ole restaurant, the rating would have been 4 stars.  But this is not just a regular ole restaurant- this restaurant is rated as one of the top places in NYC, and in the world. Well I am dumbfounded! I do not exaggerate when I say I have been looking forward to coming here for months and I left feeling so completely disappointed. Not the feeling I thought I would have after this dining experience.\\n\\nThe ambiance was nothing special. Its a large room with high ceilings and no style, plus it was freezing (ladies beware). The staff was excellent- no complaints there. But the food, le sigh, the food was truly underwhelming. First 2 courses were promising and consisted of caviar and oysters. But after that it was pretty basic and certainly not memorable. The lobster tail was ok, the duck was fine, the foie gras was satisfactory, the desert was eatable - but these aren't words I want to use when the check is over $1,000! I want my damn mind blown, but instead I was left wondering why everything was so, well, meh?\\n\\nI have been blessed to eat in some incredible restaurants like Per se, Blue Hill at Stone Farms, Le Bernardin, French Laundry, etc - But Eleven Madison didn't live up to the hype, reputation or price tag. No desire to ever return and super bummed.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Disappointing. Can't believe this was #1 (and now #4) in the world!!! I just had #6 and #7 (Central and Maido) in the past 24 hours and I'm appalled that EMP ranks above them. Who are they paying to even make the Top 10?!?\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, service was on point and the venue is nice but the food was nothing amazing in terms of satisfaction. It was presented creatively (snail tacos were cool) and we liked the table-side prep of one of the dishes, but to us there was no consistent wow factor in terms of actual taste. Seems like it was all more for show than anything. If you're in NYC, your time -- and money--will be better spent at #12, Bluehill at Stonebarns.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Eleven Madison Park was on my friend's bucket list of restaurants to dine at. So we made it happen. It topped the list of the best 50 restaurants in the world in 2017 https://www.theworlds50best.com/The-List-2017/1-10/Eleven-Madison-Park.html, 2018 https://www.theworlds50best.com/The-List-2018/1-10/Eleven-Madison-Park.html, and it has 3 Michelin Stars. It's currently considered the best restaurant in North America in 2018 and ranked 4th in the world. Dining in the main dining area lunch or dinner will run you about $315 per person before tax. Hot tip: they offer a 5-course bar tasting for $175 per person plus tax. Gratuity is already included in the price so that's all you should expect to pay. Reservations are strongly recommended. They require payment when booking with very little likelihood of refunds (check the refund policy on the website). We went with the bar tasting during the lunch hour on a Friday. When we arrived, they knew exactly who we were, which is impressive and unnerving at the same time. They took our coats when we checked in, we made a quick stop at the ladies room to wash our hands, and then we were shown the way to our table. We ordered some drinks to begin and while they had some great offerings on the cocktail menu, I asked for a Gold Rush. Eleven Madison Park is located at 11 Madison Avenue, easily assessable via public transportation. The restaurant itself is beautiful with high ceilings and gorgeous windows. The servers were great. The food was next level in gastronomy. \\n\\nWe were given choices in our 5-course bar menu. We were also given a printed menu at the end of our meal. One of my friend's was celebrating her birthday as well and they wished her a happy birthday on the menu. I had the following:\\n\\nBlack and white - this was the amuse bouche which was a savory cookie with cheddar and apple. \\n\\nCaviar - served in a tin with egg omelette, corn, and ham served with housemade mini English muffins. This was decadent, rich, and lovely. I'd never had caviar in this way but it was surprisingly good. I ate the entire thing. We really loved the English muffins too and could have just feasted on those. \\n\\nFoie gras - this was served with eggplant and mint in bar shape, decorated with edible flowers. This was so pretty but I put it in my mouth anyway. The flavors were sublime. The texture was to be expected from foie gras. My friend who didn't like foie in this way opted for the melon course. \\n\\nLobster - we all had this lobster course with greens and bean ecrasse. They poured this liquid over it and it was delicious. The lobster was delicate and not fishy at all. I wasn't sure I would enjoy it but I did. \\n\\nDuck - I was the only one to order the duck with honey and lavender glaze served with blueberries and onion on the side. There were more edible flowers. It was a gorgeous dish. My friends opted for the dry aged beef. I loved the duck because skin was encrusted with all these herbs. The flavors were amazing on the tongue. The blueberries and onion was an odd side but it worked. \\n\\nSide note: my friend found a hair on her dish and they took it back immediately offering her profuse apologies and another entrée. She refused because she was full, so we all ended up getting an extra course which consisted of the Triple Crème (cherry jam and basil crème fraiche). The Triple Crème was served with their housemade brioche and it was really amazing. We asked for more bread. Is that bad? \\nFor dessert we were given the choice of the Chocolate or the Blackberry. I went with Chocolate - sorbet with shortbread crust and a coffee meringue. The Blackberry dish was berry ice cream and granita with caramelized milk and lemon. Dessert was gorgeously plated and was sublime. \\n\\nLastly, we were given chocolate pretzels and an ounce of Eleven Madison Park's very own Apple Brandy. The apple brandy was very strong. The chocolate pretzels were a tasty end to an otherwise amazing meal. But they weren't done, when they presented the printed menu, they gave us each a jar of housemade granola https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014304-eleven-madison-park-granola to take home. Dining here was definitely a checkmark off the bucket list. Despite the snafu, they responded with grace and generosity. We had an extraordinary and memorable experience. If you're celebrating something special, this is a place I would definitely recommend.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Looking at the past couple of year\\'s photos/menu, I could understand why they were the \\'world\\'s best restaurant\\' and perhaps why they\\'re not anymore. These pictures showed showed more exquisite dishes. I expected caviar, lobster, heavenly seafood/meats to be thrown at me but its a lot more of bread, more bread, and then fruits/veggies and a little bit of the luxury dishes. I think some of food were a little too basic and some that I eat casually on a regular night out maybe not caviar though. I understand preparation and skills are completely different though. This is shown more in detail if you visit the kitchen (it\\'s insanely clean and organized). \\n\\nIf you\\'re not bothered by the ~$350 price tag per person and want a memorable experience then I would recommend it. I don\\'t think the food was entirely worth it, but the overall experience, sure. My family were happy with many of the dishes and found the price tag worthy (not that easy for my Asian parents to be impressed btw). Service was impeccable and friendly as expected. I do think the dinner was a little too long (~3 hours) but I ended up being full despite the small portions. \\n\\nWe were even able to tour the kitchen for a little bit, which was one of the best part (I\\'d recommend that you ask prior to your reservation!) Plus you\\'ll get a little treat! We had a raspberry with lemon \"lollipop.\" Since I celebrated my birthday here I even got a beautiful chocolate bar along with their usual parting gifts (granola and a list of dishes you had in a tin). \\n\\nOnto some of the food.. \\n\\nBlack and white cookie- 3/5 This was a cookie made with cheddar and apple. I\\'m not crazy about cookies so this was just okay to me, kinda tasted like a classier ritz cracker with cheese. This was left on the table and everyone gets one piece. \\n\\nTomato Tea- 4/5 I\\'ve had tomato soup and other soupy like things with tomato but never a tomato TEA. This looked exactly like tea and not its vibrant red color. It\\'s quite light yet it almost wants to be like a tomato soup (slightly thick/heavier) but its not quite there. This was probably one of the most unique thing I\\'ve tasted. They had a summer herb bundle, which made the tea beautiful and appealing. \\n\\nDosa- 5/5 I really enjoyed this with the goat cheese and green tomatoes. I think it really suited the dosa well. The dosa itself was crispy and had basil (?) on one end of it and a great starter. \\n\\nTomato Salad with Summer Berries-4/5 I\\'m very picky with tomatoes, I will mostly eat tomatoes on the vine or tomatoes from farmer markets, and that\\'s about it. These tomatoes were lovely and delicious along with the sweet and juicy berries. A refreshing, enjoyable, and light dish to go along with the other tomato themed dishes. \\n\\nCorn soufflé- 4.5/5 This is what I was expecting-caviar. This dish was pretty delicious, the caviar was slightly salty but the corn soufflé and crème fraîche balances it out nicely. \\n\\nCrab- 4.5/5 This was one of the most beautiful and tastiest dishes. It was a crab salad with zucchini and lemon. Thinly sliced zucchini (thank God, because I\\'m not a really big fan of zucchini and this was actually bearable) and beneath it was this jello like film which was really tasty with the crab. I really loved the presentation of this as well- so pretty~!\\n\\nLobster-3/5 I was honestly a little disappointed with this dish because the server gave unequal amounts of sauce with it and I felt like the lobster was a little undercooked and chewy. I had to swallow a whole piece because it wasn\\'t cutting up properly. This was wrapped in some kind of herb or vegetable and it was getting kinda repetitive. I think it could have been done without the extra wrapping and just butter-poached lobster with some veggies on the side or something. \\n\\nChanterelles-4.5/5 Any sort of fire being brought to the table excites me (I\\'m not a pyromania or anything like that) but when they brought a mini grill for the 5 of us I thought it was pretty cool. The grilled chanterelles were pretty delicious along with the onions. They give you a veggie wrap along with several condiments (not really sure exactly what they were), but when I mixed it altogether, it tasted really great! \\n\\nHalibut-3/5 This was a bit of a letdown because I thought it was a bit too basic and tasted similar to something my dad makes. The halibut was served with lemon verbena and ginger, but the sauce tasted slightly like honey and was on the sweeter side. \\n\\nPeach-4.5/5 I love peaches- they\\'re just so sweet and juicy. This dish wasn\\'t overly sweet and there was honey custard and compote to balance everything out. \\n\\nChocolate Covered Pretzel- 3/5 This was way too much. I think it would have ended better on the previous dessert. This was overly sweet and made me think of stealing my grandma\\'s insulin shot (I didn\\'t though). My mother and father couldn\\'t even finish it and I had to force it down.\\n',\n",
       " \"What can I say, this place is an experience and truly 5 stars. From the bartenders that'll mix whatever is to your liking, to the amazing courses, the superb staff, this place is an extremely strong recommend. It's no wonder it's consistently in the top ten restaurants in the world.\\n\",\n",
       " \"While I feel like my review will not make a difference given the popularity and the great reputation of this place, I was so impressed that I feel the need to write another five star review for Eleven Madison Park. \\n\\nWe ordered a wine paired tasting menu. It was a spectacle of great visual presentation and unforgettable taste. The flavors were really unique and I don't think Eleven Madison Park has many rivals in that department. And it was not just a new spin on old favorites. Rather, every appetizer, every dish was a unique creation. \\n\\nWe also requested a free tour of the kitchen. You obviously don't actually get to walk around the kitchen, but they set up a small station for you with cute treats and give you a five minute overview (with beautiful copper pots and pans on display). \\n\\nThe tasting menu is a bit expensive, but I'm glad we did it. It's really one of those experiences you think back to and don't regret the money spent.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Quite a belated review, as I dined here in March for our anniversary and it's nearly October, but I needed to sit on this experience to fully digest (pun intended) everything that occurred during the meal before formulating my opinion. My final conclusion is that the meal was fine, even great, but the experience as a whole simply did not live up to the hype. \\n\\nI recommend coming here during the lunch service for best photo opportunities, because if you're paying 1k+ for a meal, you best be taking as many pictures as possible. \\n\\nFor all the talk about fantastic service here, we had quite a prolonged and awkward experience. It started with a misunderstand between the choices offered which subsequently led to extremely stilted exchanges with our server throughout the rest of our four hour meal. Then there was also a spot of sauce that the server (a separate one) accidentally rubbed across and firmly into our tablecloth. And then the whole truffle that was dropped onto the ground mid-preparation. \\n\\nAnd then comes the philosophical question of whether ANYONE really needs to sit through a four hour marathon of a meal. The courses were, of course, beautiful and expertly crafted but towards the tail end of the meal everything became a chore. Frankly, I haven't had another tasting menu experience in the 6 months since our visit because I had been totally turned off all aspects of fine dining. \\n\\nThat is not to say this wasn't a great experience -- because it is, it is worth the money and time to experience what is hands down one of the greatest restaurants and culinary feast in the world. The food were literal works of art, the flavors divine. But as a whole package...the experience just fell flat, likely because of how hyped up everything has become. \\n\\nNot much else to add, except that the champagne was extremely yummy :)\\n\",\n",
       " \"So I love food, and I like to  testing out restaurants, reputations. I must say, I was not disappointed on the in the 3 Michelin Star rated  restaurant. First of all the service is awesome, to the point where you even see art, as well as receiving history lessons. Portion sizes seems a little small, however, leaving their i was actually full! I can honestly say this is the perfect romantic date night  or even a nice place to propose. I especially loved at the end, where the waiter gave us a bottle apple brandy just till we were content!! 10/10 .Try the Duck  and that soufflé, caviar!! YIKESSSS.. Ohhh don't get me started and the bread, and home churned butter\\n\",\n",
       " \"Wonderful food. Wonderful service. A unique experience worth the hype. It's a place one never forgets.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I\\'m not sure how to put this.... I almost feel like the victim of an elaborate confidence scheme.\\n\\nI had wanted a special dinner to celebrate a special occasion, and Eleven Madison Park seemed like a great choice. Let me begin by saying that I think it\\'s absolutely possible for an establishment to be worth such a high price tag; in my opinion Le Bernardin is a prime example. We have been fortunate to eat at many great restaurants both in New York and around the world, and unfortunately Eleven Madison Park was not even remotely worth it, through whichever lens I choose to look: food, presentation, service you name it. \\n\\nWe were waiting and waiting for the wow moment, for the dish or course that would blow us away and make us think \"oh ok, THIS is why this place has this hype and price tag\"..... alas we waited in vain. The food did not highlight high level cooking techniques or execution on flavors and textures, let alone innovation or creativity that was supposed to be a signature element of the EMP experience. \\n\\nAll the dishes were frankly mediocre at best; the meat dishes were bland, and somehow everything was served at a lukewarm temperature. They managed to make lobster, duck, and veal all taste plain. Some of the vegetable side dishes were barely palatable, and actually cold! I don\\'t often leave food on my plate at such restaurants, but I did here. Another Yelp Reviewer described one of the leek vegetable dishes with the texture and taste of a \"cold Burger King onion ring\" and that was unfortunately extremely accurate. \\n\\nAnother course centered around an oyster mushroom, which had an \"elaborate\" tableside production (which basically just consisted of shaving truffles and saucing the dish), but turned out to be some fairly plain mushrooms chopped up and served with a mushroom sauce. The window dressing of \"tableside production\" did not make up for the bland dish that honestly just seemed like a lightly grilled mushroom.\\n\\nThe only food \"highlight\" was the house-made bread, which was objectively quite tasty and fresh. This was delivered to us midway through the entire meal on its own (which also seemed a little weird?) but it was the only \"course\" we truly enjoyed. \\n\\nWe have experienced prix-fixe multi course, multi-hour meals at other restaurants with a flow, balance and choreographed delivery of courses that was totally lacking here. The waitstaff seemed to outnumber the patrons, yet service was exceedingly slow and disjointed, and there were long breaks between even the first set of courses, including a full 20 minutes between first sitting down and any interaction with wait staff (at other places, this would have been a great opportunity for an amuse-bouche or for the main server to introduce the place/menu etc). At one point, they also \"refilled\" my still water with sparkling water. I\\'m sure the waitstaff had a long day etc., but this is Eleven Madison Park so honestly I don\\'t give a damn. There is a basic expectation of quality service.\\nLong story short, I would have been disappointed had the restaurant been $50 per person, zero Michelin stars, and unheard of. At this price, with this level of renown, we were actually shocked. Hopefully the next seasonal rotation of the menu improves on the mediocrity of food we experienced in the Winter \\'18/\\'19 menu, but consistency in excellence should be required for any 3 Michelin star place. I recommend spending your money at Le Bernardin or any of the other wonderful restaurants NYC has to offer. At the end of the day, tasty food beats any gaps in service but Eleven Madison Park did not deliver.\\n',\n",
       " \"Excellent service, food and ambience. The corner seat overlooking the entire dining room is a royal treat. To fully enjoy this experience I believe one should understand the food landscape prior to dining here. We really preferred this winter menu over the summer menu as it was more to our palette (truffle, mushroom, potato, squash, etc). Both times, the level of prep and detail was outstanding. Watson selected for my wife excellent wines from California, Oregon, France, and Switzerland. I sampled 3 different cocktails. I was amazed at all of them, with unique flavor profiles you just don't easily come across fine NY restaurants. Harry gave us a wonderful tour of the meticulous kitchen and 35 staff busy at perfecting their art. Bravo!\\n\",\n",

       " \"This is a restaurant that inside has been ranked in the top five in the world for a long time, and it is still the fourth in the world until today.  I don't need to say much about the taste of the dish and the dish itself. I specially ordered a Medium rare for the fried duck meat for the main course. I wanted to see the level of the three Michelin star chefs. as I expected, the color of the cross section of the duck meat was perfect. every layer from fully cooked to bloody was very obvious, but for the main course, I think there was a problem in the amount of food.  A gentleman next to me ordered the same duck, but his piece was at least twice as big as mine. I don't know why.  The service in the restaurant is very good. Although my English is not bad, it is not enough to order dishes. They provide waiters who can speak Chinese, which allows me to perfectly express my demand for dishes to the restaurant.  I ordered a cup of very fresh red wine, which was very comfortable with duck meat. My whole mouth was full of the fragrance of spring.  Generally speaking, this is a very good dining experience, and I would recommend my friends to come here to eat.\\n\",\n",
       " \"We went for a corporate event. I have lots of pictures but my husband's placecard with his name is in full display , and he prefers I not post it. Incredible venue, service was not to be believed, but the food was fine. Not one dish blew my socks off. Yes, it is definitely art on a plate but I'd rather have more than one bite of each course. What if I did love it? I really wanted to. I think maybe my palate just isn't what it should be as I found everything salty and I love salt. \\n\\nOne thing I did appreciate is that some bar patrons were getting rowdy and they squashed that nonsense immediately. Too many high end places won't do that because of the high price tag to get in. I think that was my favorite part. Yes, we did go to Shake Shack after. This girl was in NYC and she was still hungry!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Ranked in 2017 as the number 1 restaurant in the world, so it goes without saying it's a must try for our New York trip. The environment is nice, high ceiling and warm lighting. The service was excellent , from the moment you walk in you have their attention, I think 11 Madison have the highest waiting staff per patron ratio in most fine dinnings even when comparing to the European ones. Did i mention they have the most extensive wine list I have seen today? Ok well now you know.\\n\\nUnfortunately that is it for all the positive staffs. The food, was unfortunately subpar and let me share some of my experiences below. \\n\\nWe were greeted by gift boxes on the table, that contains caviar, butter, cheese and mushroom and freshly made potato cake, very creative and fun as we have to open each of the 10 plus gift boxes.\\n\\nYou get to choose different options for the seafood and protein course. My lobster was ok, whilst the lobster tail was cooked to perfection, the honey inspired sauce is a major let down- it was so powerful I can barely taste the lobster at all. I had the duck breast for my meat and it was very dry, the spices in the duck is once again very overpowering, that plus the chewy rubber like duck makes it a very disappointing dish. I think the worst of the night is the vegetarian option for the main ordered by one of our friends. It was essentially a small (not even big) hash brown with some purée that my friend didn't even touch. Supposedly it has cream, cheese, potato and other ingredients mixed in with some fancy layering. But when you put it in your mouth, it taste like a very creamy hash brown or mash potato with crunchy coating. \\n\\nHow this can make it into one of the mains in this supposedly number 1 restaurant in the world is beyond me. So much so that when I asked the very helpful waitress at the end of dinner on what is so special about this dish that made it on the menu, she was smiling very awkwardly and struggled to explain the techniques and uniqueness of this dish. \\n\\nI mean I do not expect the portion to be large, but for a 500 usd dinner I expect it to be exquisite and creative. It bogs my mind on why, how and what they were trying to show us with some very basic, overpowering taste dishes is beyond us. \\n\\nWould not recommend this place for others as I don't think they have shown sufficient respect to their patrons by putting up a disappointing show of efforts. \\n\\nI was hoping they can finally replace epicure in Paris as my favour fine dinning venue outside of Australia (we are Australian) but unfortunately, 11 Madison was simply not up to the task.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Like so many other lovers of food, EMP was on our NYC restaurant bucket list.  We had been to Per Se, Masa, even Aquavit for other special occasions so we felt quite excited to finally visit EMP too.  \\n\\nNow that we have been acquainted, we honestly are so very confused.  The service was fine, but not almost perfect like it had been for us at other Michelin star establishments.  There was absolutely no standouts among the food either.  Also, we were confused to find out later that a couple of what we thought were side dishes were actually considered a course (*cough*creamedkaleandbrusselsprouts*cough*)!  \\n\\nWe still give this 3 stars but in reality, this was a $1000 (tasting course plus drinks) meal that should be more like max, half that amount.\\n',\n",
       " 'I came here for a birthday dinner and everything was excellent! All of the food was great and the alcohol pairing was plentiful. I really liked that there was some choice in what you can get in comparison to a traditional tasting menu. My favorite dish from the night I went was the \"cheese course\" which was a soft pretzel with beer cheese and honeynut squash!\\n',\n",
       " \"Eleven Madison Park, led by Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, has created a masterfully elegant experience punctuated by unique offerings, knowledgeable teammates, and a classic and yet modern environment. A solid 4.5 stars. \\n\\nAMBIANCE (4/5)\\nThe restaurant, which I visited shortly before it received its #1 restaurant in the world recognition, offers a high-ceilinged, refined, large main space and spotlessly-run kitchen.\\n\\nFOOD (4.5/5)\\nAcross 14 courses, the dinner proved to be one-of-kind, delightful, and interesting. I left stuffed! \\n\\nWhile I unfortunately forgot to snap a picture of the menu, here are some of the courses I recall:\\n\\n- Black and white savory cookie\\n- Caviar eggs Benedict, deconstructed, served in a cute tin\\n- Sturgeon sabayon with chives, served in an eggshell\\n- Picnic basket \\n- Foie gras layered with cabbage (unique and yummy)\\n- Waldorf salad, made tableside (delicious)\\n- Honey and lavender roasted duck (surprisingly dry, which we mentioned when asked how the duck was - the team apologized but didn't offer a new duck or substitute dish)\\n\\nMissed out on the celery root baked in a pig's bladder this time - maybe another time! \\n\\nSERVICE (4.5/5)\\nA friend who's an alum of 11Mad kindly secured us reservations on short notice so we didn't experience the frenzied reservation process. The team was highly professional, attentive, friendly, and discreet. When we asked for recommendations on local restaurants the staff likes, the team quietly conferred and came back with a printed card with their suggestion (Gabriel Kreuther which later served as a great birthday lunch). \\n\\nOur friend had arranged for a private tour of the kitchen, complete with snow cones on which to nibble throughout. Contrary to the chaos of reality TV cooking shows, I was amazed by how operationally efficient and quiet the kitchen was. The work's divvied up across different stations, with each person a master of his/her area. \\n\\nThank you, Eleven Madison, for a very special special occasion!\\n\",\n",
       " \"Eleven Madison Park was nothing short of magical. The price may be a pain point for some (especially if you're opting for the wine pairings), but when you're devouring course after course, the rest of the world comes to a complete halt, and nothing else matters. You sit there, a fork in one hand and a knife in the other, with an expression that can only be described as a stupid, dumbfounded grin. Because in that moment, you are not the you who strolls down Fifth Avenue with shopping bags in hand, or the you who takes trips to Europe to eat the best of what chefs around the world have to offer, or even the you who works tirelessly to scrape up enough disposable income to treat yourself to a night out here. In that moment, you are part of the EMP family, and you will unquestionably be treated as such from the second you step into their doors.\\n\\nTo get some of the logistics out of the way, I came here on a Friday night at 6:15PM with my mom to celebrate her birthday. I called ahead of time to let the restaurant know the special occasion, in addition to my aversion to cheese. Along with the tasting menu, we opted for the wine pairings, along with a table-side brewing of the High Mountain Oolong tea at the end of the meal. In total, the food came out to $642 and change, and the beverages an additional $406.\\n\\nOverall, I just wanted to share my thoughts on a few different points:\\n\\n1. Wine Pairings\\n\\nWhile I enjoyed the wine pairings, if I were to return, I don't think I'd be getting it again. The wines were interesting, and they definitely paired well with the food that was presented, but ultimately, I don't think the varieties we were served justified the high cost. A vast majority of the wines were French - not really an issue, just something to keep in mind if you're not the biggest fan of wines that taste earthy and heavily reflect the terroir of where the grapes were grown.\\n\\n2. Prolonging the EMP Experience\\n\\nAt the conclusion of the meal, the restaurant gifted us a bag filled with a jar of house-made granola from that morning, along with a cleverly designed menu of all the courses we tasted that night. The menu itself is folded in the same tin can that the caviar course was presented in, and was a nice touch compared to the plain paper menus that were handed out in the past. In addition, for my mom's birthday, they also included a large chocolate bar in her bag that she has yet to taste.\\n\\n3. Table-side tea\\n\\nAt first, I didn't think the $24 price tag on a table-side experience would be worth whatever EMP had in store. Thankfully, I was proven wrong, and I actually learned a great deal about the restaurant's philosophies in brewing both tea and coffee, along with some of the science and art behind a great cup of brewed tea. The Gaiwan set they used looked and felt amazing in its pure simplicity, and the tea sommelier was kind enough to provide an extra steeping of the Oolong as well.\\n\\n4. Food\\n\\nTo quickly touch on the courses we were served that night:\\n\\n* Black and White Cookie with Cheddar and Apple - B\\n* Scallops with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter, and Scallop Broth - A+\\n* Caviar Eggs Benedict with Smoked Ham and Sturgeon - A+\\n* Foie Gras marinated with Squash and Pumpkin Seeds - A+\\n* Poached Halibut with Turnip - A\\n* Mushroom Tart with Cremini and Black Truffle & Portobello - A+\\n* Venison un Croute with Foie Gras and Civet - B\\n* Roasted Carrot with Buckwheat and Mustard - B+\\n* Baked Potato with Horseradish and Bacon - B+\\n* (Instead of Grilled Cheese) Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche Ice Cream and Cranberry - A-\\n* Pear-Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice Cream - A\\n* Chocolate Covered Pretzel & Apple Brandy - A-\\n\\nWhile EMP didn't wow us with an impeccable menu suited to our exact taste buds course after course, overall, we had a sublime evening. The granola they sent us home with is fantastic, and I'm still very happy about the fact that we got to bring home the tin can with the EMP insignia branded on the top - I actually considered just taking it during the caviar course but decided against it.\\n\\nReservations may be difficult to come by and try for, and the price tag may be even more difficult to justify, but given the chance, I would do it all again in a heartbeat. Chef Daniel Humm has created not only a stunning, innovative menu that will pique your interests throughout the meal, but also an experience that you will cherish for years to come.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Meal overall was disappointing given the three-star Michelin status. Service was fine, but nothing special. Our waitress met the basic requirements for decent service but nothing above and beyond like I would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. The foie gras dish was so bland my friend actually asked to return the dish (for amazing foie gras visit The Musket Room). We were surprised that there were no dishes that gave us the \"wow\" factor that we were anticipating. There was nothing particularly inventive in any of the dishes which was especially disappointing given such exorbitant prices. Only thing I appreciated was the prepayment/no tipping. Yelp\\'s two-star description of \"Meh. I\\'ve experienced better\" perfectly sums up our experience.\\n',\n",
       " \"I'm struggling between giving this a 3 star or 4 star review. Don't get me wrong, it's a really good restaurant and you will not be disappointed. But I think most people come here to be blown away, and it just won't happen. The first dish, the caviar soufflé was probably my favorite. And they have really great bread. Everything else was okay, nothing to really rave about. The duck was certainly interesting and tasty with the lavender and peppercorn crust, but I had a hard time cutting it with my knife. The veal was good but not super memorable. Same with the lobster, good but not great. I think the scallop was my least favorite and the husband agreed, salty and a little fishy. And the chocolate dessert kind of sucked, the pumpkin squash one is way better. Also, prepare for the pour of a $40 glass of Pinot noir to be light. A good restaurant for sure, but not my favorite. I will be generous today.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The best restaurant in the world - according to San Pellegrino - fell short of the expectations one might have for a restaurant of its supposed caliber. As has been noted already, the food here was decent, but not great; simply done, but simple to a fault. \\n\\nThe good: \\n* The tasting menu is on the more \"affordable\" side of things at ~$300 - for a 3 Michelin starred restaurant in a large metropolitan city, that\\'s a good deal \\n* The truffle course & the caviar benedict course were good\\n* The ambiance & decor of the restaurant were perfect - just the right combo of fancy / casual\\n\\nThe bad:\\n* Unfortunately, most of the plates were \"just ok\" :-( For example, the dry aged duck was tough and overcooked; the greens dish was served on top of an unappetizing slice of \"rye custard,\" aka a cold, soggy piece of rye bread; the mulled wine ice cream had ice flakes in it (indicating that it was melted, and then frozen again). Etc. \\n* Plating was not entirely impressive, which I imagine is partially due to simplicity of ingredients\\n\\nI didn\\'t walk out of the restaurant thinking that I had just eaten at the \"best restaurant in the world\", but I believe it\\'s unfair to hold any restaurant to such an impossible (if not mythical) standard. Even so, the quality of 11MP was not quite there even by regular standards. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be back, but I\\'m glad I can cross this off my bucket list!\\n',\n",
       " \"I took my best friend here for her birthday back in June when EMP was still number #1 on the top 50 restaurants list. The two of us have been lucky to experience a number of other three Michelin start restaurants and we had both wanted to add this to place to the list. While the food was executed beautifully, the overall experience was underwhelming, especially at that price point. There wasn't one dish that made us say wow and leave a lasting impression. The service was impeccable and almost over the top, but as for the food, felt that this was overhyped and dare I say... a bit bland.\\n\",\n",

       " 'My dad saw that this restaurant was considered \"the best in the world\" so we had to come see for ourselves. It was rather difficult to get a reservation at a decent time (i.e. not at 10pm, which seemed to be the only choice for weeks), but I regularly checked the website and eventually found a reservation at 7:15pm for a Thursday night. There was hardly any signage out front, so finding the restaurant wasn\\'t as easy as it should have been. I was greeted immediately after going through the revolving doors, and I took a seat near the host station and was given a glass of water while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive.\\n\\nWe were seated near the front of the restaurant. The table was large enough and the chairs were so comfortable. The service here was impeccable, as expected. Our waters were constantly refilled, crumbs brushed away, and utensils replaced throughout the evening. There were a lot of courses, so I can\\'t really remember exactly what we ate but I\\'ll highlight some of the ones that stood out to me. The corn was amazing. The duck, one of the main courses I believe, was so delicious. My brother raved about the caviar, and my dad loved the steak. The lobster was a little chewier than I would have preferred, but still really good. The snails were fun to eat. They brought out a mini grill so we could finish grilling the snails ourselves. It included 4 sauces that you can add, and then they give you some lettuce to wrap the snails around. Dessert was good too. \\n\\nI wish I could say this was the best dining experience I\\'ve ever had, but it wasn\\'t. I\\'m not really sure what it was; maybe my expectations were too high. Everything was just fine, but it was literally just that: fine. It didn\\'t wow me like some other restaurants have, and the food was delicious and presented very creatively, but I don\\'t think I would come back here because I don\\'t think it\\'s worth the price tag.\\n',\n",
       " \"This was my first time eating at a three star michelin rated restaurant and our group of three was very excited!\\n\\nThe first course being served as a bunch of presents to open was definitely a fun christmas touch. That course was really good, too. The potato pancake was awesome as well as the caviar. \\n\\nAfter that, the presentation and  service both felt kind of like just going through the motions. They even got one order wrong (brook trout rather than the ordered pan seared foie gras). \\n\\nThe poached lobster was not great. Pretty average for lobster. The halibut my sister ordered was amazing though. \\n\\nThe truffle pizza and mushroom presentation was the last presentation that stood out for me. They prepared the the truffle and thyme tart table side. That was pretty cool and the mushrooms were pretty good.  \\n\\nFor the main course,the crust on the duck was very interesting and tasty, the duck itself was about average for duck I have eaten out at restaurants. The venison my brother ordered was the best venison I've ever had. There were 2 side dishes brussels sprouts with sausage and garlic kale with a pickled egg yolk. Both were very good. \\n\\nThe cheddar apple tartlet was bland and not very interesting. I was hoping for more from the cheese course. Pretty much same with the dessert course. The little chocolate covered pretzel bonus was better than the actual dessert course. \\n\\nThe wine pairing was solid.\\n\\nOverall, the meal was tasty and the service mostly excellent, but it was still a bit disappointing from what I hoped the experience would be. Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high due to the press this restaurant has received.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Came here last night with my husband as part of our babymoon. Made reservations precisely on November 1 for last night and was excited that they would be able to accommodate our dietary restrictions. This was our second michelin star restaurant experience having been to per se two years ago and this one was far more disappointing.  At over $300 per person not including drinks I would have expected far more. Service was very good and for the most part they were attentive but where I felt things were really lacking was the quality and taste of the food. They do explain all the dishes to you in detail. I was NOT blown away by even one dish as I expected to be from what had been previously been deemed the number 1 restaurant in the world. The meal was about 9 courses but nothing was fabulous. My husband described it best by saying he just felt very underwhelmed.  The first course is cool because everything is wrapped as gifts. I did enjoy my dessert however there was only one dessert and you were asked to choose between three. I would have expected to be able to receive all three desserts again given the cost and reputation of this place. I left wanting more and feeling overall disappointed.  They do send you home with a bag a granola and a copy of your menu in cute little tins. If you're looking for a nice meal where cost is no issue then try this place, but do not expect to be blown out of the water. We did NOT receive any opportunity or offer to meet the chef or have a kitchen tour as some other reviewers described. It seems like they were better in years past and have made the experience much more mundane. I would have enjoyed the picnic basket and chocolate surprises as they apparently used to do.\\n\",\n",
       " 'After looking forward to EMP, the \"world\\'s best restaurant\" for a year, I finally got a chance to visit with a few coworkers.  EMP recently went through a massive renovation and was closed for a while and though I\\'m not sure what it looked like before, I can comment that the decor inside is not bright but not dim, clean, and fresh.  It\\'s not the overly fancy kind of decor you\\'d expect from such a place, in my opinion.  \\n\\nService was superb, as it should be for a place with this kind of reputation.  People were pulling out my chairs, replacing napkins, and always around.  \\n\\nWe started off with gift boxes around our table for 6 which was strange, as I had expected real gifts and not food in them.. definitely a nice touch for the holiday season.  Inside there were a few starters/amuse bouche.  Given the menu changes all the time here, it\\'s probably not too valuable to go into detail about everything.  The highlight of the starters was the caviar, though I wasn\\'t too big of a fan of the play on bagels and cream cheese thing they did - seemed a little cheap if I dare say.\\n\\nFor some of your dishes, you are given a choice of 1-3 options.  \\n\\nNext, I chose the cold foie gras, layered in between cabbage. Literally amazing.  I had the tilefish after that, which was very mustardy and kind of took away from the flavor of the flaky fish.  There was then a presentation of a pumpkin which sounds weird, but it was kind of cool.  They opened it up in front of you and then took it away and served the most melt in your mouth pumpkin with a light broth.  \\n\\nIn between dishes, we got an (expensive?) bottle of wine and the sommelier did a really cool presentation where they basically melted off the neck of a wine bottle - would recommend this for anyone who feels bougie.\\n\\nNext was the most DELICIOUS piece of seared duck with Sichuan peppercorn ever.  Favorite dish of the night.  This rivals Momofuku Ko\\'s duck which was one of my favorites also.\\n\\nThere were a few little side dishes and what not, but nothing to call home about.  We got a play on pretzels, cheese and beer that I really wasn\\'t a huge fan of, but everyone else loved it.\\n\\nFor dessert, we all shared all the options except the cranberry one and they were all amazing, especially the apple cider donut.  At the end we also got \"chocolate pretzels\".\\n\\nAll in all, a divine dining experience that everyone should absolutely do once, but I would not quite say this was the most amazing meal or dining experience of my life... I just wasn\\'t blown away as I was expecting to be given EMP\\'s rep, but it was still a damn good meal.\\n',\n",
       " \"We visited the restaurant in April of 2018 after reading that it had received the honor of number one restaurant in the world.  We also saw a special about the resturant on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.  Let me start by saying, I'm not disappointed that we went but it didn't quite live up to the VERY high expectations I had for it in my mind.  The dress for the restaurant is casual, meaning that you don't have to get super fancy dressed up.  I guess part of me wanted people to look more formal, given the price of the restaurant.  And that goes the same for the wait staff, they are not too dressed either.  There were many times throughout the meal, that I felt uncomfortable with the way the staff was staring at us, it made me feel uneasy.  Of course the food was all good, even though I didn't know what I was eating at times.  We have been to restuarants all over the world and for this to have the title of the number one, I just simply did not agree as I can think of a couple that I place about this one. For us the best part of the experience was the dessert; it was very creative and presented well.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Eleven Madison Park - the world's number one restaurant for 2017 as we all know and when you make plans to eat at the world's best the expectations sky rocket and I guess that's where I went wrong. \\n\\nWe got here on a Wednesday evening for a 9 pm reservation. It was my birthday so I thought what better place to have dinner than EMP. We were greeted at the door by their very courteous and professional staff , seated in the lounge till our table was ready and started off with our drinks. Cranberry cocktail was very refreshing even on a cold night and the Sauv was crisp and fruity , great selection. \\n\\nWe were seated at our table in 15 minutes and our first course that included Caviar , Beet with trout roe , cucumber with pumpernickel & salmon , potato with quail egg & mustard and Mackerel wit fennel & salmon was adjust served in gift boxes - a perfect gesture to a birthday celebration. We opened the boxes and found all these treats. It was served with everything bagel and crackers , this was a great way to start and I told myself this is totally worth all the wait. Everything mentioned above was delicious especially potato with quail egg and the caviar. It was fresh and full of flavour. My taste buds felt they were in wizard of oz. \\n\\nFoie Gras with cabbage and apple follows next. I have had Foie Gras all the way from Beijing to LA and I felt it did not keep up with the way things started , the flavour was dull and didn't quite hold itself. \\n\\nNext was Tilefish with parsnip and pike roe. I was excited for the tilefish until I was not. The parsnip and pike roe sounded it would go perfect with tilefish but again the flavour fell short. I felt they just did not blend well together and the flavour fell flat. \\n\\nFollowing the tilefish was pumpkin roasted with seaweed and bacon. It was brought to the table and cut in front of us. It smelt delicious and once presented to us with pork broth an absolute delight to eat. The flavour was perfect and the aroma just added to the texture and taste. \\n\\nThe main entree succeeded the pumpkin. I had the duck that is aged for 3 weeks glazed with honey , lavender and apple. I like duck because of the savoury flavour it carries usually. The glazing is the craftsmanship of a genius but disappointingly the duck was dried out a little more than normal which made it like any other protein just hard and deprived of its flavour. It was served with kale with pearl onion and potato confit to share which were both very decent.   \\n\\nMy favourite part of every meal to end the dinner - dessert. I had apple cider doughnut with cinnamon ice cream , you can never go wrong with that. Very well done. Finally a masterly crafted chocolate covered pretzel which cleansed the palate pretty well. Dessert I felt was average but at EMP I guess I wasn't expecting average. The berry combination that my friend had was actually very delicious and something you'd expect at a place like this. \\n\\nWe were brought a bottle of signature of EMP apple brandy to sip , on the house and it was pretty solid. If I already hadn't had 3 glasses of wine I would've definitely enjoyed it more. \\n\\nTo wrap up the evening we were brought a small bag to take home which had our menu folded in a tiny box along with some granola. A very beautiful gesture and elegantly presented. \\n\\nTo summarise , the staff went above and beyond , very pleasant and accommodating. The food was good overall but when at a place like this or at the best restaurant in the world you expect something much better than you can find elsewhere. I was a little bit disappointed but as I said in the beginning maybe I just had too high of expectations. I compared it Oriole which I felt surpassed them in flavour. \\n\\nThank you EMP for the experience :)\\n\",\n",

They even made me an extremely cute personalized driver\\'s license ID (which involved them running to a nearby Staples to get it laminated). \\n\\nBecause it was my 21st birthday, I got two cocktails. I first tried to seaweed one...which i LOVED. I followed that up with the apple cocktail, which was also very good. \\n\\nIn terms of food, it was all really exciting! Everything was presented very beautifully. I especially loved the savory cheesecake course. The so-called \"caviar\" course was a very fun homage to NYC, and the everything bagel crust was very wow. Another standout was the cookies and cream dessert. My only complaint was that I wanted more. My family and I also raved about the beer, cheese, and pretzel fondue course, the scallop broth and bread course, and the scallop and uni course. Each and every course, however, was simply amazing. I licked every plate they put in front of me clean.\\n',\n",

Fresh scallop was unique, it\\'s flattened to almost resemble pasta - kind of rubbery which wasn\\'t so great. Beet dish was meh. Next, lobster course, lovely, but not mind blowing. The dry aged veal was good, the duck was good as well. Dessert this is where the presentation should blow your mind - mrrr, mrrrr - it\\'s April - they were offering a gingerbread chocolate dish, cheese course that was a bread pudding, pumpkin and squash cake. What?! \"We haven\\'t changed to Spring menu\". What?! We enjoyed the wine pairing. I\\'d say it\\'s a skip, if on your must have restaurant tries -  it\\'s a sprinkle in the bucket at best.\\n',\n",

I\\'m gluten-free and I felt my meal was not at all compromised to accommodate my dietary needs. My courses were very similar to my husband\\'s courses, which were not GF. They even gave us goodie bags to go for us and our 4 children! The granola they give you for \"breakfast\" is delicious and allows you to reminisce about the delicious dinner you had the night before. We stayed across the street at the EDITION and we enjoyed our dining experience so much that we went to the bar to have cocktails on the other days we were in NYC. The bartenders definitely know how to craft a delicious libation. If you are planning to visit NYC, make a reservation at Eleven Madison. You will not be disappointed.\\n',\n",
       " 'tl;dr\\n\\nit\\'s not a joke - the fine dining restaurant that best embodies the spirit of NYC. your money is worth every penny here - come! rinse and repeat :)\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe love EMP. We have been here three times (07/2016, 05/2017, 12/2017) and each time it just keeps getting better. 07/2016 was our first visit and we had their \"taste of NY\" menu, which brought together an amalgam of cute NY dishes (including a \"picnic in Central Park\" and a \"clambake on Long Island\"), 05/2017 was their famed retrospective before the summer reconstruction, and 12/2017 for a Christmas/winter themed dinner. There\\'s no need to rehash every other review here but the big things for me:\\n\\n1) Their service is impeccable. I have yet to be at a restaurant with this degree of attentiveness. You can Google EMP\\'s emphasis on service online and the depths they go to train their staff, and every bit of it really shines through during your meal here. At our last visit, we actually timed them three times how long it takes them to refill an empty water glass (with the servers\\' back turned, of course) and it was never over a minute. A minute!! Averaged out about 30 seconds.\\n\\n2) There\\'s always some \"gimmick.\" Our absolutely favorite dish here that blew us away came during our first visit, when we were presented with a \"picnic in Central Park\" - the caviar course. Everything came in a wicker picnic basket with cute caviar tins (your menu for the day (customized!) goes home with you in these tins at the end of dinner -- don\\'t worry, they\\'ll give you a new one :P), light ceramic plates that were designed to look like paper plates, small crisps for the caviar wrapped in paper tied with twine, accouterments in little glass jars, and even two little bottles of house soda and champagne!! Yes!! Bottled soda that you had to open with a little bottle opener! We absolutely died at how cute this presentation was, and every visit thereafter there is always a component that required you to unwrap something and a component of tableside presentation/cooking. We have yet to experience anything that we loved in terms of presentation as much as this dish from 2016 in our travels.\\n\\n3) They have the best bread. I absolutely adore their Parker House rolls which is present on every visit and served with the most perfect Vermont salted butter. At our last visit, I commented to our server how much I loved their Parker rolls and how sad I was that I can\\'t eat a ton of them in the same sitting because I wanted to enjoy everything else....lo and behold, they put a small tupperware of 6 (SIX!!!!) rolls in our gift bag on the way out the door. TAKE MY MONEY. TAKE ALL OF IT!!!! :\\')\\n\\n4) Their wine pairings are incredibly generous. We\\'ve done either all cocktails (highly recommended) or shared a wine pairing among 2. Either way is fine and extremely enjoyable. You\\'ll have a good time. The somms are great and can tailor anything to what you want.\\n\\n5) You\\'ll get a jar of to-go granola as part of your after dinner gift per person. It truly makes the best breakfast and they even come in glass jars that you can use to store dry goods in the kitchen afterwards :)\\n\\nYou can\\'t say you\\'ve experienced NYC fine dining if you\\'ve never been to EMP. This is the #1 nice restaurant that I recommend guests from out of town/out of country to visit when they\\'re in NY. There is nothing quite like it. Truly :\\')\\n',\n",
       " \"With a reputation as prestigious as Eleven...my expectations were at an all-time high.

If you ever get the opportunity to try this place treat yo'self and do so!!!\\n\",\n",
       " \"The service was wonderful however the food was underwhelming.  The lobster tail was more like a tiny slice of lobster and the duck was more like duck bacon.

       " \"Eleven Madison Park has been an interesting ride....  When first enjoying the experience about three years ago, the evening was fantastic (a show in and of itself)!  Then came the revised menu style about two years ago with fewer dishes / not as much presentation and there was a huge drop off in the quality of the experience which made me sad that I'd never again enjoy an experience equivalent to the first (likely when they were receiving votes to move to #1). Went last night and had a lovely time!  Though still a bit of a dip from EMP of three years past, the dishes last night were delicious and we had a great time!  The staff was lovely as well.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I usually don't write reviews but felt compelled to.\\n\\nThe service was attentive without feeling pushy. I swear our main waiter had supernatural hearing. For example, I'd tell my husband I was going to the restroom and suddenly the waiter's there pulling the table out for me and showing me the way. I mentioned (quietly) to my husband that it was too bad the granola had nuts because our daughter is allergic, and the waiter comes back with a nut-free jar just for her, along with extra pretzels in a box.  We had the kitchen tour with a fun game of trying to match spices in various carbonated apple juices. \\n\\nWe had the winter menu of comfort foods: truffle dosa with apple and parmesan, potato salad with truffle, and truffle tea (which was amazing); caviar with a souffle of clam, leek, and potato (my husband's favorite); scallop with kohlrabi, sea urchin, and apple; lobster with celery root and apple tart (the lobster was buttery and the sauce delicious, but I thought the celery root a bit overpowering); roasted golden oyster mushroom (gorgeous and my favorite, I think); duck with napa cabbage and pear, leeks with cheddar and parsely, and winter squash with brown butter (the meat was tender and the skin crusty, but it was a little rich for me. I loved the squash, though); washed rind cheese fondue; pumpkin cake with butternut squash and sasaparilla; chocolate covered pretzel. \\n\\nWe had the wine pairing, which really enhanced the food, too. It was a lot of wine!\\n\\nThe whole afternoon was an experience I don't think we'll ever forget. (The only other tasting menu we've done was at Le Bernadin, which we loved as well, but this one felt more personal and customized.)\\n\",\n",
       " 'Being a former ranked \"best restaurant in the world\", the expectations were huge. As we went in we noticed a few things such as the opulently high ceilings and the elegant interior design. Everything pointed out to be a glorious night of pleasure and umami. Every dish was perfectly executed, but sadly nothing blew me away. Not the flavors in order to live up to such high honors, nor the chef\\'s creativity and pairing of ingredients and the service lacked true carrying. Our server seemed to just go through the motions and Couldn\\'t answer a couple of questions I threw at him which he should\\'ve been trained to answer at a venue like this.\\n\\nOne thing that was quite weird in my opinion is how the server gives you the verbal option of picking different dishes. The options were not even written and felt peer pressured to make a quick decision.\\n\\nIt seems that food critics place a huge premium on table side service as I though this restaurant doesn\\'t deserve to be idolized the way it does...\\n\\nBest part of the meal was the take home granola and the printed menu placed in a quirky little box.\\n',\n",

       " 'I\\'m torn. $350 for lunch which i believe is the same price for dinner. A 3 hour 11 course menu. It\\'s once held the controversial \"worlds best restaurant\" and arguably ranks as the best or at least top 3 in New York.  While the food was good I don\\'t know if anything I had necessarily blew me away. Service was ok, probably mediocre but I left my first 3 star Michelin experience wondering if Per Se or Le Bernadin or others will be similar. If similar is the case, not sure if I would come back to spend  another $350. Yes this is my most vague review probably but, I can\\'t seem to muster a review, everything was good just underwhelming.\\n',\n",
       " \"A good experience as it was my first Michelin 3  restaurant. But it definitely wasn't value for the money ($$$$). May be the menu on the day was too monotonous or may be because I went on a Monday night. The place has an ok vibe. I dont think I will visit again. Hope others have a better experience!\\n\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been holding off on writing this review as I reflected on my experience at EMP. Once ranked the #1 restaurant in the world and currently ranked the #4 in the world - I really did expect more.\\n\\nFood - 3.5/5: Many of the dishes were very good and some were misses. Overall the food did reflect New York clearly, but emphasized technique over flavor and innovation.\\n\\nService - 1/5: The service really was some of the worse I have received at a fine dining establishment. The waiters were not very friendly and quite condescending when we asked any questions that were outside \"what is in the dish\".\\n\\nLowlight: When we asked about splitting a wine pairing - they unkindly made us feel silly for even asking. There are betters ways to approach this such as offering some potentially well paired bottles or glasses. This made some of my dining companions so uncomfortable that they didn\\'t even want to drink from the wines I had ordered, feeling that they would be \"judged\" by the waitstaff.\\n\\nWhile the food is decent, the atmosphere and particularly the service leaves a lot to be desired. In comparison to similar ranked restaurants such as Mugaritz, Azurmendi, Pujol, Quintonil, to name a few - the service here is not only bad, but completely detracted from the experience.\\n',\n",
       " \"I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday dinner during the spring two years ago and I was so surprised. I don't know how to act in fancy restaurants because I'm not used to that scene and I felt so out of place and awkward. I quickly stopped feeling that way because the servers were explaining each dish as they arrived and were able to repeat anything to us if we didn't hear them the first time. One of the servers noticed we were trying to take a selfie and offered to take photos of us. Later as we got another dish, the same server came back and asked if we would like another photo because the table spread is better than the empty table we had before. It's the small things that matter! \\n\\nThe inside of EMP is very elegant and clean. As we were eating and chatting, I found myself enjoying the fact that I could hear the other patrons chatting, but not really hear what they were saying.\\n\\nI was blown away by the plating and the creativity of each dish. I very clearly remember the salted fish cheesecake which was so strange, but surprisingly good. My boyfriend doesn't like cheese or butter, so when it came to the bread with the goat cheese butter, he got the farm butter without the cheese because he still wanted to try the butter. He ended up enjoying it so much, he was brave enough to try the butter with cheese on top. Turns out he just enjoyed the butter and the flakiness of the bread. We didn't particularly like the goat cheese panna cotta, but that's because we're not fans of goat cheese/milk. When the chocolate pretzels and moonshine came out, I got so excited for the chocolate pretzels because who doesn't love pretzels?! It was good. The moonshine, however, is very strong and burns as it goes down. Just when I thought dinner was over and I was ready to feel sad that this experience would be done, the server brought us gift bags with the caviar tins we ate out of before. Inside the tins was the night's menu. In my menu, they had happy birthday on it and even gave me an extra chocolate bar with the EMP logo on the paper wrapper. I left feeling giddy and excited and I knew all other fancy restaurants would be ruined for me because of the wonderful service, atmosphere, and food EMP had. \\n\\nAlso, side note, at the end of the experience, when the people who greeted us handed us our coats, I took mine and walked outside with it because I didn't realize that they were holding our coats so they could help us put it on. Awkward for everyone, but also something nice to laugh about afterwards.\\n\\nAll in all, I highly recommend EMP because it's THE BEST. I was unfortunate enough to be able to go to Le Bernardin and Daniel several months after EMP and found the other two restaurants to be lacking.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The food was delicious but the service was amazing. Thank you for making our valentine's day so memorable. We would Iike to take the time out to thank Chris, Carly, Donovan, Madison, Rebecca and lastly, Hartley who was so kind enough to walk me to the bathroom and she's 8 months pregnant too. Very kind. We are very grateful and so happy we picked Eleven Madison Park for dinner tonight! Thank you all. Hope we didn't leave anyone out.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Oh Eleven Madison Park. How I wanted to love you so; yet I was left a bit disappointed. We were greeted kindly and seated promptly with a warm towel for our hands. At that point I thought, \"Alright, this is going to compare if not beat the type of experience I had at The French Laundry.\" After all it was rated number one in the world in 2017.  \\n\\n From there we were greeted by a Somalia and offered drinks. They went over the menu and then asked if we wanted duck or the rib-eye. Not ever having duck before, I played it safe and my husband and I both said rib-eye.  The first couple of courses were really good. I really liked the tomato tea and dosa. It was quite different but flavorful. The bread with the butter and salt was very good as well. The caviar souffle I really wanted to like but it was just too fishy. They brought out and cooked at our table blackened escargot and basically we made escargot lettuce wraps. My first bite was really good but then my second, I got a taste of the mini snail (which I have never had before) and it was all over from there. I didn\\'t want to finish it but for the amount of money we paid, I bared through it. \\n\\nThen came out the meat course . I thought that the \"rib-eye\" looked a bit strange but I thought it looked like beef. Then we were given non-serrated knives and I thought it was a bit strange. I had a really hard time cutting this meat that I thought was rib-eye. It didn\\'t taste like your typical steak and it was a bit fatty and slippery and not what I thought it was going to be. Well that\\'s because it wasn\\'t rib-eye. We were both given the wrong thing from what we ordered and we ended up with duck.  Now, it\\'s typically not a big deal for me getting the wrong thing at a non-Michelin rated restaurant because my expectations are just non existent and I am not the type of person who is high maintenance and makes mountains out of mole hills. However, this was super disappointing and for the amount of money we paid it was just something that shouldn\\'t happen at a 3 star Michelin restaurant. We kindly told them we were given the wrong thing and they brought us both the rib-eye and they said we could finish the duck as well but it just wasn\\'t my cup of tea and I didn\\'t finish it. The rib-eye was very good and tasted like beef and it was delicious. They gave us granola with cherries when we left and that was pretty good. \\n\\nThe service was just okay compared to The French Laundry. The French Laundry was literally a masterpiece of a production. They cleared plates and silverware and brought us new plates and silverware on que upon finishing each course.  Eleven Madison was not like that at all. We had dirty dishes sit on the table for a while before the next course. I guess I just had higher expectations for Eleven Madison Park thinking it would be just like The French Laundry if not better due to being rated one of the best restaurants in the world. I for sure left disappointed and probably won\\'t go back.\\n',\n",
       " 'VERY BAD SERVICE. I went to EMP two years ago but when today my friends asked me about the experience, they all insisted me to write it down. So what happened was that the waiter dropped a glass of wine on my boyfriend\\'s trousers and the wine also spilled onto his white shoes. There was no apology from the waiter. He didn\\'t say any word. \\nSeems like he didn\\'t feel sorry at all. All he did was clean up the spill on the floor, picked up all the broken glass pieces, and went away. \\nHe then came back with a new glass of wine, but still didn\\'t say anything. I\\'m pretty sure he can speak because he speaks a lot when introducing us about the dishes. We were stupid that we gave him normal tips. \\nFour stars for the food, my boyfriend enjoyed the \"picnic scene\" course but the caviar that day was below the level. Negative stars for the service. Very arrogant waiter. Two stars in total.\\n',\n",

I won\\'t say it\\'s the fanciest Michelin restaurant, but I wasn\\'t disappointed. \\nThere\\'s some hiccup while we were having our meal, the servers handled it very well; good attitude and good service recovery!\\nFood wise, I won\\'t comment much as most of the time I realized you really need a different taste palette to enjoy; also you need to be a little more educated to understand what kind of effort they have put in for each dish. \\nIf you don\\'t understand good quality ice makes better cocktail, or if you don\\'t know giving escargot special diet does mean something - then you probably won\\'t appreciate this restaurant. I have seen people who only care glamorous complain about EMP, but first educate yourself so you know they have gone above and beyond. And they make \"above and beyond\" as their routine. \\nEvery single detail is being taken care of at the moment you walk into this restaurant; it\\'s so subtle that you probably won\\'t notice it.\\n',\n",

       " \"TLDR: worth checking out for the experience, but have had better food at a lower price point; creative dishes; excellent service; dining in luxury\\n\\nHave never been to a three star Michelin restaurant before and with its recent renovation and #1 status on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in 2017, Eleven Madison Park seemed like the right pick. Despite its steep price point (~$350 per person for the tasting menu, inclusive of tax and tip), reservations are difficult to come by, so a friend and I planned about a month and a half in advance. Reservations through Tock open up the first of every month at 9am ET for reservations during the subsequent month. We secured a 9pm reservation on a Friday through the help of the American Express Concierge.\\n\\nOn the night of our reservation, we were warmly greeted by the hostesses and had our coats checked. The main dining room was bright and elegant, with high ceilings, large windows, crown moulding, modern chandeliers, and white table cloth tables. The bar area was a bit more intimate, with dim lighting, a fully-stocked back-lit bar, and large lounge chairs.\\n\\nService was impeccable, where everyone addressed you by your name, took extra precaution around allergies, and generally made you feel like royalty. Our meal lasted about four hours, and we decided to order a bottle of red wine to pair with our tasting menu. Luckily, they gave us a tin with a paper accordion listing everything we ate (listed below with commentary). I can't remember when it was served, but there was also a bread course with salted butter. The bread was soft, warm, buttery, and generally amazing--we enjoyed it so much we got two servings of it. We were also given a tin of granola to take home.  \\n\\n1. Black and white cookie with cheddar and apple - small savory bites; kind of reminded me of fancy cheez-its in regards to taste\\n2. Asparagus with smoked egg salad, daikon with ramps and pike roe, quail egg with radish and mustard greens, and spring peas with trout roe and lemon - served on wooden hexagons; light and refreshing\\n3. Cheesecake with smoked sturgeon, caviar, everything bagel, and white asparagus - similar in texture to a traditional cheesecake, but savory\\n4. Fluke marinated with daikon and sorrel - light and refreshing, similar to ceviche\\n5. Lobster butter-poached with ginger and dandelion greens - one of my favorite courses; lobster was perfectly cooked and flavorful\\n6. Snails grilled with morels and ramps - the presentation of this was really entertaining, as the snails were on kebab sticks and cooked at the table in a large fire; flavorful combination of snails and mushrooms\\n7. Lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella - this was a bit of a disappointment, as the lamb tasted overcooked / old; the other option was duck, which my friend got--I tried a bite of that and it was pretty good\\n8. Mustard greens with garlic and horseradish and snow peas with goat cheese and lemon - tasty accompaniments to our main courses \\n9. Goat cheese variations with rhubarb chutney - I didn't particularly like this course, as it wasn't quite sweet enough to feel like a dessert and the texture was a bit mushy\\n10. Chocolate with milk ice cream and shortbread - rich and sweet; the chocolate was balanced out well by the milk ice cream\\n11. Chocolate covered pretzel served with apple brandy - tasted like any other chocolate covered pretzel; the apple brandy was strong and aromatic; an entire bottle was served to us and we were told we could have as much as we liked (we both only had one serving though)\\n\\nWhile the food was good, I would hesitate to say it was worth $350. However, I'd recommend going once for a special occasion based on the overall experience.\\n\",\n",

Eleven Madison Park has been ranked the number one restaurant in the world and is the holder of 3 Michelin Stars so who am I to give it less than 5 stars (for a Yelp review). \\n\\nEleven Madison Park is a exactly what you would expect from a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant. The detail to the service, food and cocktails are exceptional. The spacious art deco decor of the restaurant adds to the atmosphere - invokes an air of grandeur that is fitting for the production that will unfold over the 3 hour tasting menu.\\n\\nDaniel Humm's cooking is heart of the hallowed Eleven Madison Park. He is a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. \\n\\nWe tried the spring tasting menu. Some of the highlights included: (1) cheesecake with smoke sturgeon caviar, (2) lobster butter poached with ginger and dandelion greens, (3) snails grilled with morels and ramps, and (4) lamb with fava bean relish and nepitella.  The dishes were all innovative and creative. It was essentially art on a plate. \\n\\nDining at Eleven Madison Park will set you back $315 (US) per person (before cocktails). It is definitely worth the price if you enjoy food and fine dining.  Eleven Madison Park is one of the best. \\n\\nI have been asked how Eleven Madison Park compared to other 3 Michelin Stars restaurants such as Per Se, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges, Joel Robuchon and Alain Ducasse. It is difficult to compare. I enjoyed all of these restaurants. There were dishes that were unique to each of these restaurants that I enjoyed. All of these 3 Michelin Stars restaurants were worth the money paid.  What you have to keep in mind is that a 3 Michelin Stars restaurant is a production - it is the opportunity to experience some of the best dishes prepared by some of the best Chefs in the industry.\\n\",\n",

We had the eleven course retrospective menu, and I can't emphasize enough how perfect the whole experience was.\\nI am not going to elaborate on each and one of the courses because it will literally be my repeating the same adjectives over and over again trying to describe how impressed I was. Pictures say more than the words so I have attached some photos. Presentation of each dish was very pretty, and the server explained about each course.. how and where they fit into the chronological timeline of EMP.\\nI really enjoyed how they made the carrot tartare in front of each table,how they poured the sea water to our seafood dish to reproduce the atmosphere of where the ingredients came from, and many other presentations that kept us captivated.\\nFood was excellent, dessert was excellent, service was excellent. We were full after the eleven courses but they serve you enough portion for each course so that you don't leave with uncomfortable feeling.\\nI'm sure it's obvious but drinks, coffee, teas are extra (not part of $300).

       " \"I'm not sure what there is to say that's not already been said. Eleven Madison Park was a superb dining experience. There's a reason it's consistently showered with awards and placed on prestigious list after prestigious list. Things here are done so impeccably, so pristinely, it almost felt too composed. The amount of preparation that so clearly goes into every aspect of the EMP experience is truly remarkable. The menu, the service, the wine pairings--all choreographed and executed to perfection. I suppose one should expect this considering the price tag on a meal here. But you never really know until you try. And try, we did. \\n\\nMy boyfriend--the best there is and ever was--got us a reservation here for my birthday. I'm a big-time foodie, but not the type you'll find at Michelin spots. I like to splurge when I dine out, but there's a line and places like the EMPs, Per Ses and Le Bernadines of the world are far beyond what I'm willing/able to pay. So this was just all kinds of special. Now, this point is important because I don't have any similar experiences to compare our night at EMP to. We've never done a long tasting menu before and we've only done a handful of prix fixe nights out. But I've had the pleasure of eating at a lot of really really good restaurants in NYC, so I'd like to think my two cents is still worth something. \\n\\nSo we arrived here for our 8:45 reservation and walked into splendor. Coats were taken and we were delivered to our seats. We opted for the standard wine pairing, which is $175/pp. If you're going to drink and are a fan of wine, I think this is probably your best option. It's expensive, but the alcohol on the menu here is just wildly expensive--even the half-bottles (try to keep in mind that I'm a millennial with a modest salary who has a hobby that she really has no business trying to afford)--so the pairing made the most sense for us. And it was delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered different dishes when the option was available to try as many dishes as possible, which meant we got to sample a wonderful variety of wines as well. The only instance in which I'd recommend going with a bottle or half-bottle (or cocktails) is if you're a lightweight/aren't a huge drinker. I think the pairing amounts to about 4-5 glasses of wine, which might be a serious undertaking for some. That said, the meal does last 3+ hours so the alcohol intake is somewhat moderated. \\n\\nWhen I review restaurants, I tend to list the dishes we try and grade each one. We had a nine-course meal at EMP, so it would be hopeless (for the sheer reason that I'd run out of characters almost immediately, a roadblock I face virtually every time I write a review on here). I'll list what we received here but give some more general commentary/give little shoutouts to the highlights. All listed chronologically to give an idea of flow:\\n\\n*Apple / Cheddar Black and White Cookie: A+\\n*Scallop Live with Sea Urchin, Scallop Butter and Broth: A+\\n*Caviar Benedict with Smoked Ham, Sturgeon, and Hollandaise, served \\nw/ mini English Muffins: A++\\nSquid grilled w/ Juniper and Horseradish: A+\\nFoie Gras Seared w/ Maple and Apple: A++\\nLobster butter-poached w/ Butternut Squash and Chestnut: A++\\nHalibut poached w/ variations of Turnip: A\\n*Mushroom Tarte w/ Crimini and Black Truffle: A++\\n*Crimini and Portobello served w/ mains: A\\nHoney and Lavender-glazed Duck w/ Cabbage: A+\\n*Potato baked w/ Horseradish and Bacon: A\\n*Leek w/ roasted Hazelnut and Parmesan: A\\nVenison en Croute w/ Fois Gras and Civet: A+\\n*Cheese tart: A+\\nPear Donut: A+\\nChocolate-covered Pretzels\\n* = both received\\n\\nThe only real surprise with everything here was the presentation/aesthetics. Nothing was particularly colorful or fancy. Quite simple, superficially, far more complex when you take a bite. I don't know if that's intentional on EMP's part, but it was almost peculiar. That's hardly a gripe though, everything was just delicious and brought out at the perfect pace. The wine pairings were delightful, thoughtful and certainly enhanced the consumption experience. Highlights/notes:\\n-The black and white cookie was as a mind-f*** and a tasty one at that\\n-Everyone should wrap their uni in a live scallop blanket \\n-Hard to get more decadent than caviar eggs benedict and my god, I have never tried to take a longer time eating something\\n-You will never insult squid again by ordering it fried after having this squid preparation\\n-I said that thing about decadence with the eggs benny but I maybe already changed my mind because that foie gras knocked me over\\n-The best entertainment out there is watching someone shave truffle over something you're about to eat and then eating that something with pride\\n-Duck can be big, ugly, messy and tasty or elegant, refined, clean and tasty. I love duck. Duck is tasty. This duck was as good as it gets. \\n-I don't like donuts but I loved this donut. What else is new?\\n\\n-Gold pretzels. Mic drop.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Flew to New York as a surprise anniversary gift from my husband. I've been wanting to go to this restaurant since our last trip with family and friends two years ago but it's very tough to get reservations for a big group at this restaurant. Specially during the holidays. \\n\\nLess than a week before our flight we made reservations at various restaurants that came highly recommended. Then the day before our flight, I glanced upon a book while I was rearranging our credenza in the dining room. It's the Eleven Madison Park book that I've kept in our dining room! I thought we might as well try to make the reservation and hope for the best! They had no available seating so we chose the option the join the waitlist because it says sold out on the dates we chose. Then the next morning, aboard the plane right before our flight we got a call about a cancellation and we were told that there's an availability! I was so happy! This was meant to be! \\n\\nThe restaurant is beautiful specially the huge windows where you can see the trees at Madison Park! I enjoyed every dish that was served! The ingredients were very fresh and just delicious! The dishes that stood out is the Camembert cheese with creme fraiche and basil/parsley pesto, escargot with mushroom that was served on a tabletop grill and then you remove it with tweezers and wrap it in lettuce & chard leaf and the cookie that was given first that's in a box  before the start of the meal. The duck and the steak was good but nothing memorable or exceptional. I also absolutely love the dish with caviar. It was deliciously prepared! \\n\\nAfter our meal we got to tour their kitchen! It was surprising to see 40 plus people in there! Everyone were very focused on each dish they are making. It looks very artistic, creative and so beautiful! \\n\\nThey change menus every season! I'm looking forward to trying their winter menu next time! \\nHopefully on our next lunch/dinner here we get to catch a glimpse  of the genius Mr. Humm!\\n\",\n",

But the dishes are so much more than flavorful -- they are a treat for all the senses. Each course was completely distinct in its own way while subtly building off the flavors of previous dishes to provide a fully satisfying culinary experience.\\n\\n--FOR THE VEGGIES: My fiancé, after some pretty extensive research, selected this restaurant precisely because they were said to have one of the best vegetarian tasting menus, and we were not disappointed. \\n\\n--THE SERVICE: Our visit to Eleven Madison was in honor of a special occasion -- my fiancé had just proposed to me a few hours before -- and Eleven Madison made the day even more memorable with fabulous service. We were welcomed with complimentary champagne served in Tiffany glasses that they later gave to us as an engagement gift (with the signature box, ribbon, and bag of course). They also graciously gave us a second momento--a hand drawn guide to the herbal blooms featured in our meal, since my fiancé had shown such interest in them. We left so thoroughly impressed by the intimate, courteous service and the personalized, unique gifts.\\n\\n--THE ATMOSPHERE: We dined at Eleven Madison during the day when it was full of natural light that accentuated the elegant minimalist decor. Although the dining room was full, it maintained a peaceful, quiet feel.\\n\",\n",

The meal was beyond our expectations. \\n\\nWe started with a 1/2 hour of champagne and pass around bites. It's hard to say which bite was packed with more flavor. The white fish with caviar, the carrot tartare with horseradish, the scallops on the half shell or the fois gras with strawberries. The bites were small but so flavorful and balanced. The best part was seeing everyone's faces with each bite. \\n\\nThe entrees, dessert, wedding cake, and wine selections were also truly amazing. When we asked our guests, what was the tastiest dish, the answer was unanimous. EVERYTHING!  The poached lobster and tornados of beef were amazing choices. \\n\\nI need to mention the excellent service. From start to finish the staff was warm, friendly, welcoming and gracious attending to our guests individual needs. \\n\\nBy the time we left I felt I had one of the best dining experiences ever. This was an expensive meal but well worth it. Thanks Eleven Madison Park.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I was looking forward to this dinner for a month since booking. First off, it's an extremely long experience - 3 1/2 hours+ - negative for me.  The food is innovative, fresh, seasonal but of the 9 courses only a few were memorable.  I did not like the duck one bit.  Venison was excellent.  Lobster was just OK.  I didn't finish the cheese course - apple and cheddar...or the dessert - I chose poached pear. I just wanted dinner to be over by that point. I think my main course of duck really steered the remainder of the experience in the wrong direction. Service is professional - some employees are warmer than others but professional nonetheless.  Honestly, save yourself $600+. We aren't foodies but thought we would try this for the experience and to be blown away but we weren't.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Contemporary American restaurant. Favorite dish is definitely the caviar ham Benedict. The flavor and presentation was memorable. \\n\\nGreat services from beginning to end. There are probably more people working than people eating in the restaurant. Lol. Not the most expensive Michelin three star in NYC, but the experience was great. Complimentary bottle of granola at the end, and even a tour of the kitchen! \\n\\nFor the interior, love the super high ceiling and huge window. The view was beautiful. Really enjoyed the dinning experience overall.\\n',\n",
       " \"This review is long overdue, but definitely necessary. When you plan to eat at Eleven Madison Park, it has to be one of those dining experience that you save for a special occasion. With a name like this, you know that you are getting upscale service and cuisine. Even reading the name out loud makes me feel like I need to be wear something prim and proper when I eat here. \\n\\nAt first you walk in and the building looks like an old bank building; high ceilings and very classy. The service is great off the bat. Everyone is so friendly and wanting to make your dining experience memorable. The overall atmosphere was casual and not as stuck up as I thought it would be. \\n\\nWith the tasting menu, we tried a variety of dishes. The most memorable for me was the celery root being cooked inside an animal's stomach I believe, and they do this at your table. Another great dish was their oysters which was served two ways on one plate: savory and sweet. So delectable. My favorite though was the lobster dish. Bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. I liked their savory dishes more than the sweet. As we go through each dish, I notice their flavors are more traditional. I tasted a lot of maple syrup and apple flavors in multiple courses, but the presentation is always creative and out of the box. \\n\\nAs a final treat after all that good food, they also gave us some homemade granola to go as a nice parting gift. So nice of them. \\n\\nIf you are a foodie, want to impress a date, spoil your significant other, or just want an unique dinner experience, Eleven Madison Park is a place to try.\\n\",\n",

All the food was good, but nothing that would make me want to come back again or insist that other people try.

Every bite brings different tastes and reactions.  There were extremely high points in the meal from the fish (bass) to the amazing desserts.

Food just simply wasn't as good as other top tier restaurants such as French Laundry, Alinea, and even Chez Panisse.  For $300+ per lunch (without drinks), you expect some mind-blowing taste!\\n\\nI think it was a total of 12 courses?\\n\\nFirst came out some little savory cheese cookies and a delicious scallop broth.   The broth was actually one of our favorite items!  Very flavorful.  Perfect salt level.  Cookies were okay, but I didn't eat them to save room for the main event.  \\n\\nScallop with sea urchin - delicious.  We enjoyed this light and refreshing dish.  I think there were some thin apple slices in it?  It was an appropriate appetizer.  \\n\\nCaviar - this is a take on Eggs Benedict with ham gelée, hollandaise custard, and sturgeon caviar.  Oh and a poached egg.  Very good.  Nothing particularly special except the container is beautiful.  \\n\\nSquid - this was good...   again, something you'd have at any good sushi restaurant.  Chopped up squid and horseradish and juniper.   We enjoyed it.  \\n\\nFoie gras - delicious.   simple sear.   But we were already starting to feel like the foods were too rich.  I didn't finish this item because I knew I couldn't get through the rest of the courses.  \\n\\nLobster - good.  A few classic bites that are butter poached.  \\n\\nHalibut - I thought this was better than the lobster!   The cabbage on the side was awesome, warming, and perfectly seasoned.  The turnip on top was very flavorful and perfectly shaped like little fish scales.  \\n\\nMushroom Tart - delicious broth and i loved the mushrooms!   But at this point, we're getting full and even though they put probably $400 worth of truffles on our food it's like...  what's the point?  They tasted earthy but that's about it.  Just some dry truffle shavings on a cracker...  didn't do it for me.   \\n \\nVenison - this is a take on a Beef Wellington and again while good, nothing to write home about.  More foie gras.  Actually getting tired of foie gras and truffles at this point.  How is that even possible?\\n\\nDuck with Cabbage -  this is actually featured in the Eleven cookbook - it's a beauty with lavender and Szechuan peppercorns on top.  They went a bit too far with the dry-roasted seasonings on top I think.   I don't really want to be biting through whole peppercorns and such but it does look nice.  Is it the best duck I've ever had?  No.  \\n\\nTrip to the kitchen -  so apparently if you ask you can visit the kitchen and see the amazing working they do back there...  plus they make you a great bite with (more) black truffle made into a mousse and piped into a cornet.  Kind of like the cone that they have at French Laundry.  I guess this is an homage to that.  It's okay but I didn't bother finishing it.  Too full and the black truffles were not flavorful no offense.  \\n\\nTubby cheese -  at this point we're sick of eating, so I don't even remember this.  I think it was good.  It came with a mediocre dressed salad.  \\n\\nChocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche ice cream - good.  Don't know what else to say.  \\n\\nPear Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice cream - okay so this donut is AWFUL.  I don't know who came up with this weird sour donut but it's gross.  but, the ice cream on the side is delicious!  I don't even like or eat dessert and I could bathe in this stuff man!\\n\\nApple Brandy and pretzel chocolates -  oh so they bring you a whole bottle of brandy at the end and you can stay and drink as much as you like...  I did my part and had two shots!\\n\\nOverall...  not the best restaurant in the world in terms of taste or ambiance.  Service is great!  But for the money I think next time I'd rather do a Le Bernadin, or Per Se.  \\n\\nIt was a fun experience but was it worth $700 for two people?...   ehhhh\\n\",\n",

       " 'I am snobby enough to have thought that all the hype over the years about EMP was just that, no way it could be that good. Well, I stand corrected, EMP has definitely earned its title as best restaurant in the world (per 2017\\'s San Pellegrino\\'s list). For those of you that like me, may have been living under a rock these last several years, EMP offers an 11-course tasting menu (estimated to take about 3.5 hours to get through) and a policy of asking for payment when the reservation is booked (leaving you to only pay for your drinks on the night of the reservation). Since EMP is slated to close this summer in order to undergo huge kitchen and dining room reservations, the menu they are currently offering is their greatest hits dishes from over the year.\\n\\nEvery dish was amazing. From the simpler (in presentation anyway) dishes such as gougeres with grated gruyere to grinding up carrots tableside for their carrot tartare dish or serving a turbot with zucchini scales, everything was phenomenal. My personal favority was a foie gras torchon which maple syrup on the inside.\\n\\nThe service was top notch as well. I asked for one of the hostess\\'s where the ladies room and waited for her to give the regular \"turn right/left and walk down the corridor...\" instructions. But not at EMP. Here I was escorted all the way to the door of the ladies room.\\n\\nThe pacing of the meal was excellent as well. Since it was just two of us for dinner and we didn\\'t end up drinking, we finished up after about 2.5 hours. However, it seemed that we were not the norm as we finished far in advance of the other tables that were leisurely enjoying their wine pairing, etc.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the meal had to be our interaction with the general manager(?) at the end. We ordered tableside tea (more curious about what that entailed than anything else) and were treated with a wonderful presentation where he discussed and demonstrated a one versus three-steeping process and answered our questions about the restaurant renovations and what would happen to the staff (they are opening a pop-up restaurant over the summer in the Hampton\\'s and a major driver of that decision was to provide employment to their best asset... their people).\\n\\nLastly, they finished off the meal with offering us a complementary glass of brandy for my husband and sparkling (non-alcoholic) cider for me. I was very impressed with how well they were paying attention. My husband had ordered 1-drink at the bar while (due to a crappy cold) I ordered two non-alcoholic drinks and mostly drank water at the table. The waitstaff, with everything else going on, was able to notice that my husband would be inclined to drink the brandy, while correctly surmising that I would need to go the non-alcoholic route.\\n\\nThe final impressive touch came with our parting gift. Most of the high-end restaurants are now in the habit of providing an extra food treat to take home and EMP was no exception, except that instead of a tiny tin of cookies or chocolate, we received two large glass canisters of granola.\\n',\n",

Some dishes come with quite the presentation which you should expect. \\nI scored a tour of the kitchen and I was so appreciative as the experience never gets old. They had row upon row of ducks hanging and it reminded me of an image you might see in a cartoon except this image was very real and I knew within a short period of time, I would be dining on one of those ducks.\\n The entire staff that I came into contact with were very professional and courteous. Rene was my server and she was wonderful. They definitely know how to take care of their guests which was shocking to discover that they do not accept gratuity! I have dined all over the world as some of the most exquisite restaurants and this is the first time that I have encountered one of this quality where gratuity was not necessary. \\nThe food was exquisite and while there is no need to go into detail about every dish as the menu changes seasonally, the lavender crusted duck was magnificent. The flavors....wow.\\nSo, Eleven stares the #1 spot with French Laundry, except the biggest difference is at FL, they gave me so many desserts, I felt like I was Marie Antoinette and I was in heaven as dessert is so my thing. Eleven is way more conservative on this point. I had a choice of 1 dessert, I also got their infamous delish chocolate covered pretzel with a shot of apple brandy and to go, I was presented with their granola with blueberries which I savored over the course of 2 days.

You will enjoy the general feeling of the product, but you can't really distinguish the actual food's taste.\\n\\nThe only exception is perhaps the main dish. We had ribeyes and duck breast. They both emphasized tenderness and flavor. But they also mixed in their own novelty.\\n\\nTo be honest, I would rather feel the original flavor of the ingredients.

We liked that we had some options throughout the courses, something we had not experience at other tasting menu restaurants. The service was amazing, it was really cool to watch, almost like an orchestrated dance. Our cocktails were great and the wine pairing ( we only got one and shared it ) was amazing. The only reason I am giving a 4 star review and not a 5( man how I really wish I could give a 5, this is killing me ) is because of the coffee at the end of the meal. Our waiter gave us our options for dessert and explained the cheese course and at that point he asked if we wanted coffee or lattes. I ordered a decaf latte to have with my Apple fritter donut. Out came our cheese course, then our dessert. No coffee. Then came the post meal drink and some chocolate pretzels to snack on. Still no coffee. The waiter at that time did say, your latte is on its way. No apology however for how long it was taking and for the fact that it didn't come with dessert. Finally , the latte arrived. Basically when we were ready to go. Usually I would not complain about something small like this. However this meal cost us over $1000. I kind of expect every single thing to be perfect, and for them to have at least offered to comp the coffee.\\n\",\n",

Just one thing: together with the cheese course, the restaurant should be ready to serve some bread, if the guest wishes so.

Lau, the maitre'd, got a rose for my girl, and a customized card, that was a nice touch. Some of the dishes were great, such as the black truffle tea and dosa, caviar soufflé, the halibut, and my personal favorite, the honey lavender duck. Some others, like the butternut squash and the scallop, were misses and tasted weird. The cheese dish was also way too salty. The chocolate pretzel was too sweet. \\nI put my phone in the box to get a chocolate at the end of the dinner, but they seemed to have forgotten to give my phone back; I had to ask for it. -1 star. Everyone else also got complimentary shots of brandy, I wasn't aware of the shots being complimentary until I went on yelp and read about it. They didn't even offer it to me and my gf, minus another star for that. They took our coats at the door, and had them ready for us as we were about to leave, that was really nice. This would've easily been a 4-5 star review had it not been for the mishaps towards the end. A three Michelin star restaurant shouldn't make mistakes like this.\\n\",\n",

Black Cat - Bourbon based with hints of espresso and lemon. This was served in an old fashioned glass with a large rock.

My absolute favorites of the night were the egg salad asparagus and snow pea fish egg starters, the bread (tasted like a croissant!), the incredible caviar course with a savory cheesecake and everything bagel crust, my amazing spring salad, the lobster, the table grilled snails with morels, and my mom's chocolate dessert!

And I\\'m usually extremely generous with 5 star ratings. But if you\\'re going to be #1 you have to really be #1. Honestly the ambiance, service, and attention to detail is top top. It\\'s why they\\'re rated what they are. But the food was only good! It\\'s so disappointing! I expected flavors, dishes I\\'d wish I could try again but wouldn\\'t be able to until I somehow came back here. Not 1. If it wasn\\'t for the service I\\'d say my rating would be a 3, maybe even a 2 because of price. I think the missing factor was that the food was bland. In fact the newly renovated venue was pretty bland and underwhelming as well.\\n\\nNow for the positives! Did a tour of the kitchen, it\\'s totally calm and huge and clean and beautiful. Real masterpiece back there since the renovations. There\\'s a real relaxing vibe to the place, that was great. You also get about 10 different servers come to you throughout the night, felt like we were hosted by the whole kitchen - staff really cares about what they do and take it super seriously. That was nice. I think they also do a great job of accommodating. If I had an allergy, or didn\\'t like a certain type of food, you get the impression they\\'ll drive over to McDonald\\'s to get you a burger if that\\'s what they think you really want and to accommodate you. Unfortunately I eat everything and I\\'m not a picky difficult person so I couldn\\'t benefit personally from that level of accommodation they definitely excel at. \\n\\nBottom line: they need to rethink their tasting menu because if you\\'re #1, you can\\'t have ok dishes. The dishes were just ok. Nothing amazing. Everyone I was with agreed. I\\'ve ate at many Michelin star rated restaurants and high end restaurants in general. EMP you have to really please introduce some WOW factor into the menu because everything was just OK.\\n',\n",

The overall experience is pretty good, however I don't think it was the best food or most memorable experience I've ever had. Most importantly, I FOUND A PIECE OF HAIR IN MY DRINK. I had to flag down my waiter and he was able to change it for me. A bit later towards the end of the meal, a tiny tiny tiny bug flew into my cheese course... so I just stop eating. \\n\\nI had the Dining Room summer Tasting menu. Tomato soup, Foie gras, lobster, snails were amazing. Pan seared foie gras was so buttery and juicy, it was one of my fav of all time. The summer menu though consists of a lot of tomatoes.. like a lot of tomatoes.\\n\",\n",

Everything was really good and definitely live up to the 3 Michelin stars reputation. I'm not sure how this is necessary the number 1 Restaurant on the 50 world's Restaurant list, not saying they don't deserve it, but makes me wonder what's the criteria to make the determination. Having gone to Central, Maido, Alinea, Andre and Le Berdine on that list, it's not easy for me to tell how this is THE best. It would be good if we get a list of criteria from the 50 world's restaurant list in order to make the proper comparison. Nevertheless with that said, it was a wonderful dining experience. We traveled here from California, and it was worth the journey!\\n\",\n",

It was as if they pumped more oxygen into the room to keep me calm and relaxed just by being there. \\n\\nThis review is hard for me because I am honestly not sure whether to give 4 or 5 stars. Despite everything being good, there was only 1 dish that I thought was truly amazing flavor-wise. And that was their mushroom dish. Everything else was extremely visually appealing and the whole experience was wonderful, but as a true foodie it is tough for me to give them a perfect 5. \\n\\nThe way in which each dish is presented definitely gave me moments of awe as I sat there mesmerized at the presentation and manipulation of common ingredients brought about in different ways.\\n\\nNote: Everything was good but only 1 was great\\n\\nAs for the service and experience it is definitely 5 stars for me. At the end of the meal, they give you your personalized  tasting menu written in the order of presentation alongside some oats for breakfast the next day. One of the things that gave me such an added boost is that there is no dress code!!! Yes no dress code!! Just be comfortable!\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend anyone who is willing to spend a little, to give this place a try as the experience is dazzling, the servers are friendly, and they make you feel like victorian age nobility. However, I don't think I would return for a long time due to the difficulty in procuring a reservation and maybe cause my palette just isn't sophisticated enough to be completely entranced with their food.\\n\",\n",

I booked this meal for my husband's birthday and it was a great experience.   I don't think I have even prepaid any meals in my lifetime but hey there's first time for everything.  So I booked the Bar tasting menu.  When we arrived out table was not ready but the hostess make sure we were comfortable and seated in the waiting area.  She was pleasant and approachable as not being stuffy as I would imagine a place of 3-star Michelin would be.  Later we were told that our bar table would not be ready in time and hey upgraded us to the dining room and also from 5 to 8 tasting menu.  Who would say no to that! It is a Nuevo cuisine restaurant which means it is traditional in the sense that it is small plate, taste and presentation in such that it is about quality and not quantity.  The wine pairing and the choices of their wine is far most the most impressive thing about this place! I think the food is great but the wine it excellent.  We were told tonight was the first summer tasting menu so I have to say it was perfect.  So why the 4 but not 5 stars? Well I am not going to lie, this was wonderful but I was still hungry after this very expensive meal.  It is neuvo cuisine after all.\\n\",\n",

Every single dish was executed to perfection, from flavors to textures to presentation. The clam dish was absolutely perfect, and stood out more than any other dish. The sturgeon + caviar + cauliflour cheesecake with the \"everything bagel\" had so much going on, and yet, still seemed to harmoniously combine all of the flavors together. The aged duck was stunningly delicious. I could go on and on about every single dish, but you get the picture.\\n\\nThe service was top notch, and yet, unpretentious.

About 20 different people served our table throughout the night. One gentleman really knew his scotch and my boyfriend was very impressed with that! \\n\\nThe food, I\\'ve read mixed reviews about it but for me.. everything was amazing! Lots of intense flavors, mixed textures, supple meats, and overall just a personalized and truly unique dining experience!

       " \"I have been super excited to try EMP, especially after the new renovations. Unfortunately, here is my honest review of the place.\\n\\nBefore I even go into the details, let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant. But if it is deemed the best of the best, then I will hold it by those standards. It did fall short of those expectations and as such, I'm giving it a 3 star rating. It may be harsh, but you're spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Even before you get to the restaurant, someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect. It's a great personal touch. \\n- There were some great dishes, the lobster bisque sauce was perfect. The pretzel was amazing. I also really enjoyed the veal. \\n- The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive. \\n- The kitchen tour was a nice touch, especially to show off the new set up\\n\\nCons:\\n- The dinner is too long. I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places. We had a 6:15 start and didn't finish until around 10:20. \\n- The dishes were good but not amazing. I can't honestly say any one dish blew me away. \\n- At one point, one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me. Now this wasn't a big deal on its own, as mistakes happen. It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber. So after she spilled the wine on my jacket, she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table. She apologized and handed me a towel.  Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels. All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table. I'm not expecting a freebie but I've been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least. At the end, I had to ask for a new one myself. Normally not a huge deal, but if you're the best restaurant in the world...\\n\\nOverall, EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go. I am harsher on my critique as I expected to be blown away and was not. \\n\\nEither way, congrats on the new renovations and thank you for the great night.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I hesitated slightly in giving this a 1 or 2 stars, after all it has 3 michelin stars so who am I to judge?  But that said, I have dined at almost ten 3 michelin starred restaurants and several 2 and 1 starred restaurants...and this one barely deserves 1 star when compared to my experiences.  There are plenty of other 3-starred restaurants in NYC that are far superior than this one.  So for a price tag of about $400/pp (after taxes and beverages), go elsewhere.  If you dont want to read the whole review, let me illustrate it in a few senctences.  My husband is a huge lover of cheese and he was starving by the time we arrived for dinner.  Near the end, there was a cheese course.  Not only did I think it was gross, but my hungry cheese-loving husband couldn\\'t even finish it.  And no, the waiters did not ask if there was something wrong nor was a replacement offered.\\n\\nNow, let me break this down:\\n\\n1. Service: pretty standard 3 michelin quality service.  Attentive and meticulous.  But do they go above of and beyond?  No.  We came a week after our wedding and they were aware of this.  We had just finished a trip to Napa and perhaps we had been spoiled, but nearly every place we went, they somehow acknowledged this point with a complimentary toast or small dessert or even a congratulatory note in the end.  Now if you go somewhere and say it\\'s your birthday or anniversary or honeymoon, i don\\'t expect every restaurant to do something special, but hey, my standards are high when the price tag calls for perfection.  Another point: there were definitely gaps between dishes when we had nothing in front of us.  We weren\\'t eating too fast.  The couple next to us experienced the same thing.  No, not when I am paying for perfection, I don\\'t expect to wait 10 minutes between courses. \\n\\n2. Food taste: the flavors were all over the place but overall uninteresting and bland.   And they have some sort of obsession with radishes.  They might be going for some theme, but there was definitely some pickled radish or sour pickled vegetable on 3 straight dishes.  Where\\'s the variety in flavor and texture?\\n\\n3. Food presentation: this is where it all falls apart to the point of zero stars, to the point of utter disappointment.  With the exception of perhaps the first 2 and last courses, the colors were very white and single toned.  The presentation was also very boring.  Again, standards are higher for a 3 michelin star affair and one always eats with their eyes before their mouths.  And i could barely swallow at the appearance of some of the dishes.  White on white yells \"i don\\'t care about this dish.\"\\n\\n4. Ambiance and decor: average.  Overall nice with high ceilings.  However, the corner cushioned seats we sat in were dirtied with crumbs. I wonder if the prior patrons had left some crumbs.  But again this lack of attention to details is quite upsetting.  Who wants to skooch into a seat only to discover your sitting on gritty crumbs??!\\n \\n5. Last note. They come with a wonderful presentation of a baked Alaska for dessert.  The torching is on an ~8 inch diameter dessert.  They then take it away to prepare the dessert for you...when they return, you get a piece the size of a half-dollar coin.  Where\\'s the rest of my baked Alaska?  Also, my husband feels a similar shrinkage in size occurred with the lobster dish, but I thought maybe the crustacean naturally shrinks after cooking...who knows.\\n\\nSeriously, I have never felt that my money went to waste when I\\'ve dined at a 3 Michelin star restaurant, but here I felt gypped.\\n',\n",
       " \"I won't add to all the well-deserved kudos, dining there was an ethereal experience.  I simply wanted to comment on the wine flights.  They come in the 170 and the 350 ranges, so my wife and I tried one of each.  The 170 version did not offer much that was special, and while the 350 version had a couple of extraordinary things on it (a perfectly balanced Sauternes, a 2004 Châteauneuf and a wonderfully weird thick sherry from Andalucia), it was disappointing.  To begin, you are given more white than red wine (I'm a red drinker mainly), and lots of champagne at the beginning, a wine I've never quite seen the point of (so sue me).  Moreover, since we were there early, at 6, many of the bottles were just opened and took time to develop in the glass; and since you're only getting a few sips, your experience with the best of each one is limited.  This was especially true of the Chassagne-Montrachet, which only tasted like the wonderful wine I know in the last sip.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to uncork some bottles early and let them breathe a little in the bottle.  In any case, if you know something about wine and rely on the wait staff (which knows them well) you are probably better off getting your own bottle or two half-bottles. For $500+  you could really indulge in something special.\\n\",\n",

I picked the duck over the oxtail (good choice on my part). I honestly had an amazing thing here. My favorite dish was the caviar- SERIOUSLY WHAT IS IN HERE?!?!?! I WOULD BUY TONS OF IT (if I didn't become homeless afterwards). I think it is around 70 bucks regularly if you order a la carte. BUT REALLY WHAT IS IN THERE. HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. Real talk. \\n\\nThe other dishes weren't that memorable- duck was great- not so sure about the skin but it cooked perfectly! I liked that they gave you a granola jar to take home (Um...DELICIOUS granola just FYI- u want to eat that asap). \\n\\nCame here for the experience and I think it's worth it (at least once).

There's also an option for seared foie gras, but I prefer chilled, maybe will try seated next time if they still have it.\\n\\nLobster, which was smoked and steamed at the table and then taken back to be plated, with fennel, clam and bouillabaisse. I don't like licorice flavor, but the fennel was not overpowering.\\n\\nFor the vegetable course I chose the Butternut squash, which was roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds and my boyfriend got sweet potato wrapped in bacon with maple syrup glaze.  Both were very delicious.\\n\\nFor the main dish, there was a choice between duck and oxtail. I chose the duck, which was glazed with honey and lavender with plum and onion. The skin was perfectly crispy and there were subtle Indian flavors on the skin from cumin. I would've preferred a sweeter glaze, but the duck was still delicious and cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend enjoyed his oxtail but I thought the duck was better.\\nThey give you 2 side dishes with the main course: Brussel sprouts roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds, which were amazing and parsnip purée with variations of juniper, also very good.\\n\\nAfter the main course was a cheese course with bitter greens, which for me was basically a deep fried cheeseball and was delicious. My boyfriend's version wasn't deep fried.\\n\\nFor dessert we chose the baked Alaska, which was huge and prepared table side. Though tasty it was a bit too sweet and alcohol flavored for me to finish.\\n\\nThere's also the fun game where you match the chocolate bars with the type of milk (cow, buffalo, sheep and goat), I got the sheep and goat right, but switched the cow and buffalo.\\n\\nThe chocolate covered pretzel with sea salt was delicious and gluten free!\\n\\nOverall I'm glad I finally returned for dinner. I'm looking forward to coming back after they reopen when the renovations are done, and maybe we will stop by their Hamptons pop up this summer!\\n\",\n",

       " 'Was treated to a meal here by a friend and the 10 of us sat in a private room upstairs.  The menu seemed perfect, a mix of my favorites and everything I would want to hit up at a meal like this.  The service was very good as expected, though I would have expected more knowledge of ingredients for such an establishment.  Waiter was not sure the origin of the beef besides it being from Pat La Freda, the waitress was not sure of the name of the town in LI the salt came from, and not much info on the type of duck breast we were eating besides it being dry aged 14 days. Quick summary, 3 of the 9 dishes including amuse were inedible. Lets start with that amuse which was some sort of porcini cream in egg shell.  the first bite was so salt, I thought I just got a lump of salt, but the next bite confirmed it was all too salty and I tried it once more to make sure and could not finish.  Most people at table agreed.  Eggs Benedict course was a nice caviar dish reminiscent of the Jewish holidays, as it was basically caviar on top of whitefish salad that was probably made with cream cheese or butter.  Then came the Foie gras torchon which was nice, creamy, elegant, but should have been served with toast to cut the creaminess.  It was small, but tough to finish because it tasted like you were eating raw butter. next came butter poached lobster which was nice but poorly poached which left the lobster chewy.  The turnip, just yuck, not bad, gross.  Don\\'t know what to say.  Many of the dishes actually had a very similar umami flavor, but just way too woodsy. Next was beef, was a roasted filet of unknown origin besides pat la freda.  covered in trumped mushrooms and served with a chestnut gravy.  My meat had a nice crust and perfectly cooked interior.  Was super duper tender and nice.  I tried a friends leftover and hers was leftover because it was all just red center without much crust because she had a center cut piece when mine had been an end cut.  Meat was good, but really expected something more special at EMP, maybe something with some age.  Next up was the duck which was the star of the night.  The szechuan pepper corns made my tongue tingle a little.  the skin was crispy and the meat was a perfect medium rare.  I finished 2 other people\\'s duck as well. Next course of \"honeynut squash\" was actually a cheese course and was the third inedible dish of the night. the cracker was nice, but the squash cheddar mix was not for me, or most at the table.  Finished off with the Milk and Honey which like the duck was also amazing and what I expected of EMP.  On the way out, we were given the granola for breakfast in the AM but I finished most of mine in the uber home, its special. Overall very disappointed in the meal.  Can\\'t believe there were 3 courses I literally could not finish based on the taste.  I\\'m an animal and have a really hard time not finishing everything in front of me! not here.  I think it was perhaps a result of not eating from main kitchen where they obviously keep their A team.\\n',\n",
       " 'This restaurant used to be ranked #1 in the world (now #4), and reservations need to be made two months in advance. All of this means I arrived with very high expectations. On the whole, those expectations were met. The food was outstanding, and the presentation amazing, from the gift box with the savory black and white cookie inside which formed the first course to the jar of sweet granola in the elegant to-go bag, which wound up the meal. The foie gras was on the salty side, but the cheesecake with caviar was absolutely delicious. Each course, as well as the wine-pairings, was carefully explained, and the service, just what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. If anything, the service was a bit too good.  There was a constant stream of circulating waiters. That, together with the décor, made the experience less than perfectly comfortable. The restaurant was recently renovated, but the stark, bright white interior décor is not really to my taste.\\n',\n",

       " '\"Whimsical\" still best describes the dining experience at EMP. Expect the unexpected.\\n\\nBeyond excited to return and experience the updated menu and concept, our group of six actually extended the trip one more night to fit this restaurant in.  Will travel for food. Clearly. I love my tribe! Welcomed by sommelier Jane Lopes (of the Uncorked reality series following six aspiring master sommeliers as they prepare for the Court of Masters Sommelier exam), dinner started on a fun note. If you haven\\'t watched the series, get to it! Fan-girl moment aside, Jane happily put up with all of our questions and decanted our wine. Two enthusiastic thumbs up from her for our choice too!\\n\\nWe never ordered off a printed menu, unlike my first visit four years ago. The waiter simply asked about allergies and questioned us about our preferences; dinner began shortly afterward. Much like before, dishes were plated with great attention to detail. Most of the time, a fun twist ensued. The unknown is part of the experience.\\n\\nCenter stage on the table, a large number of holiday wrapped gifts sat begging for our attention. We had a hunch it would probably be our first course (and not just decor). We were right. Well played, given Christmas was only a couple of weeks away. Designed to complement the caviar -with smoked sturgeon, cream cheese, bagels, and rye crisps-, a selection of small jars filled box after box: beet salad with apple & trout roe, smoked salmon with cucumber & pumpernickel, potato salad with mustard & quail egg, smoked mackerel & salmon with fennel. Boom! Welcome to Eleven Madison Park. Dinner\\'s only just begun. It took us a while to get through them all, mixing and matching as we went along. I love a place that encourages one to play with food.\\n\\nThis year, the Foie Gras, Honey Nut Squash (sage + cinnamon), Lobster (butter poached with rutabaga and pear), and Duck (honey and lavender glazed with turnip and huckleberry) impressed me the most. I happily sat there relishing each second that went by. I never wanted the three-hour-plus dinner to end. I can appreciate (and admire) all it took to birth them all.\\n\\nServed with mixed greens that actually worked very well and in a rare EMP moment, the photogenic \"Cheese Course\" (really a cheddar tart seamlessly disguised inside of an apple), wowed with its presentation, but disappointed us with its overpowering one-dimensional cheddar taste. Additionally, despite its showy flambéing right on the table, I couldn\\'t enjoy the Baked Alaska. The rum drowned the vanilla and meringue\\'s sweet and delicate taste, instead of enhancing it. Thankfully, the chocolate \"Name the Milk\" game ended dinner on a high note. For the record, I failed the test miserably. Pfft. Must. Play. Again. Complimentary St. George Apple Brandy was offered towards the end, but at 40% proof, I couldn\\'t take more than a couple of sips. Ouch! Kudos to the women next to us who gulped much of it down. Impressive!\\n\\nOnce again, I witnessed one of the white cloud-like tablecloths ironed and perfected on the spot. No creases accepted here. That attention to detail is what I know the staff strives for with every table serviced.  It\\'s important to note these highly awarded restaurants keep raising the bar themselves, time after time. I\\'ve now come to expect the perfection with each visit; it\\'s part of the marvel and draw.\\n\\nOnce finished, we received jars of the famous EMP granola as a keepsake, along with a very carefully designed and curated copy of the night\\'s menu.\\n\\nFull payment is required in advance. The set price excludes corkage fees, beverages, and tax. Like many NYC restaurants now, gratuities are not accepted. If you are planning a visit, check the website for the ticket release dates and reserve way ahead of time.\\n\\nDespite some minor hiccups, Eleven Madison Park still reigns as one of our country\\'s best restaurants.\\n\\nIt simply has to be experienced.\\n',\n",

You know it's good when you wake up dreaming about what you ate the night before.  Awesome service, each course was memorable, wine pairings bucked the stereotypical pairings from average somms, more generous wine pours than other high end restaurants, and there's enough spacing between tables such that the conversations from neighbors was not that noticeable.  I only wish the restaurant was a bit more intimate and not so cavernous.  --  Slowly chasing the #Worlds50BestRestaurants...\\n\",\n",
       " \"Came here for an early bday celebration courtesy of my boss and wow this did not disappoint. I've always wanted to come back after trying their restaurant menu here, glad to say I did and honestly every dollar spent here is worth it. The service was absolutely impeccable from getting seated to checking your outerwear to all of the servers memorizing the wine list, the menu by heart without skipping a beat. The food was exceptional, foie gras, lobster, oysters two ways, the well known duck breast sold to us easily just from how our server described it to us. I can see why they maintained 3 Michelin stars and is the number one in the world. I would most definitely come back to try their other variations of the menu. The ambience was perfect but I was definitely not prepared for the amount of black truffle they would serve for us and that is a definite winner. 3 hours dinner minimum to be prepared to be here to enjoy and bask in all that emp has to offer. And for those that are weak on the wallet, this place is not for you. If you don't believe in spending money to enjoy excellent food, ambiance and service, you shouldn't be a patron here. Honestly if you're the type to eat the bare minimum to survive, this go elsewhere. Every morsel here is a taste of luxury and well worth it.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I've had one good and one bad experience, averaging four stars.  Our first experience was beyond world-class.  Flawless in every way.  Our next experience was an opposite one, so I'll talk about that.\\n\\nFirst, our captain was a ghost.  Had she engaged the table more than a brief visit, she would have noticed that the kitchen was dragging.  The sommelier, who IS world-class, should have also noticed that she was pouring our pairings thirty minutes before our courses arrived to a dry glass.  She also failed to spend more than 30 seconds per pour, leaving us with the name of each wine and vintage, with no pairing notes or other useful information.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I waited toward the end of the courses to voice my frustration.  The manager approached and informed me that the menu was transitioning, which is fine, but not in a live dining room at this level.  He offered nothing more than an apology for a blown evening.  A future reservation guarantee would have been an appropriate gesture.  He also could have ensured that his floor was staffed in a way that allowed our potentially amazing sommelier to exercise her amazingness as she was clearly stretched.\\n\\nI'm profoundly disappointed and would like to give it another shot, but I honestly don't consider EMP even close to the best in the world or even the best in the country.  Our first experience definitely held to that standard, but consistency is imperative as guests are usually going to remember their worst experience, which is also likely to be their last.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The price they asking is just outrageous considering the food offered. I wish I could say I enjoyed it. After all, we booked months ahead and spent over a grand for the dinner. But I can't even said it was good tasting, not to mention outstanding. The service is very attentive, too attentive that it somehow making me felt a bit...uncomfortable? This place is just overrated and overpriced.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Now I feel I can accurately write a review now that I have done the tasting menu in the main dining room (rather than just the bar- see my tip). I brought my fiancé here for his 30th birthday because all this guy wants is a good meal, and a good meal he received. I would say there were about 12 \"courses\"- from mushroom appetizers, mini English muffins with eggs Benedict caviar, lobster, venison steak, potatoes with hazelnut spread, chocolate covered pretzels- all served as one surprise after another. They also had a guess that (chocolate) milk game post-dinner and a Baked Alaska cooked right in front of you at the end. Not to mention they gave us a bottle of Brandy and basically said the table is yours for the night; I like that they don\\'t rush you out.\\n\\nIn my opinion this is definitely a special occasion kind of dinner experience. Not only for the price (about 300$ per person), but also that it isn\\'t your ordinary 3-course dining experience. The maitre de emailed me to ask what he could do to make the experience extra special- I recommend getting a kitchen tour because my fiancé LOVED this surprise! The maitre de said he would leave a note for my fiancé if I told him what to write, but for some reason the note was MIA which was a bit disappointing. However, they had a \"happy birthday\" note at least. They also gave us a departing souvineer which I appreciate for my \"memory box\"- all the courses listed on a scroll type of menu, with our names on it. \\n\\n**Be aware that reservations are necessary and are online now, about 2 months in advance. I thought it was by phone and only a month prior, which was a mistake- and luckily Amex Concierge pulled through or we would have never gotten in.\\n\\n\\nGreat service, great food, great night.

To this day I have never eaten at a restaurant that matched their level of service.\\n\\nEating at Emp showed me how truly delicious food could be. I've eaten out a lot and I've worked at Michelin starred resteraunts but something changed in me after this dining experience. Certain courses nearly brought tears to my eyes from how amazing it was.\\n\\nWhat amazes me is how much they are constantly changing the menu. A lot of high end resteraunts just recycle the same dishes over and over again. I've heard some people not enjoy it as much but maybe the menu didn't match with them at this time. I think everyone should experience this level of perfection at least once in their lifetime.\\n\",\n",

Yum! \\n\\n11 courses but I think it was really 13... either way 11 was good enough and then some. \\n\\nIf you plan on going here, make sure you have time, it took 3-4hours.

I had been looking forward to having their dry-aged duck for quite some time.

Coincidentally, we were expecting baby #2 thus when they sent me an email prior to our date inquiring if we were celebrating anything in particular I just mentioned it briefly.  Most of the reviews rave about their customer service and I wholeheartedly agree with them all but I think they definitely impressed us by surprising us with a cute baby onesie with their logo on it!

They forgot. Had to ask them for one. Also, water glass was empty for a few minutes before being refilled. Other than those two slips in service, it was fine.\\nDishes: Nothing stood out. The unwrapping of the first dish was a nice touch to start the evening but afterwards I wasn't really blown away or even impressed with the rest of the courses.

We had heard amazing things about the restaurant and had booked a trip to NYC with a sole purpose of dining at EMP, so we had fairly high expectations for the experience.  We were celebrating my birthday, and a few days prior to the reservation, the maitre d' reached out asking for dining preferences, general preferences (what do I like, need, etc.), and also offered to facilitate floral arrangements on my boyfriend's behalf.  When we walked in, we were promptly seated and were greeted by a handwritten birthday card that reflected my aesthetic preferences, and the magic began.  From the engraved bag hook to a private kitchen tour, the hospitality and attention to detail was nothing short of world class.  Food was amazing as expected as well - some of my favorites from the night include the dry aged duck (my boyfriend got the venison and was pleasantly surprised as well), the potato souffle with caviar, and the truffle pot dish.  I think we spent about three hours in the restaurant.  Sometimes for me, sitting three hours through food with long gaps in between gets tiring and a little boring (this was my experience at Per Se, where the ambiance is more strict / formal), but time truly flew by and I enjoyed every minute, thanks to their amazing staff and neighboring tables. \\n\\nIt seems that their menu changes significantly every month or so, so I'll definitely come back in not too distant future.

       " 'Wow, what a night, I  left the restaurant shocked and amazed, not about how good they are of course, but  about How can that possibly be a Michelin 3 star restaurant!!? \\n\\nI literally took a day to process why Eleven Madison Park was named the Best Restaurant in the world for 2017. My conclusion is maybe that title put them at so much pressure that they have decided to go low key for this year\\'s new tasting menu. I am just out of luck that I went in a few days too late for their previous tasting menu. My night was ruined after 3 long hours of bland unappetizing food.  I\\'m visiting from LA with my boyfriend and we already dined at Per Se,  Le Bernadine, Jean Georges, the river cafe, and a couple other Michelin restaurants before our dinner here at EMP, of course we had to stop here before going back to LA in a couple days. We are both huge foodies and dine out everyday, and we do know how to properly appreciate food. I tried so hard to love EMP, I really did, but I just can\\'t:(  I rarely write reviews about restaurants on Yelp because I usually don\\'t have too strong of a feeling towards them, So EMP really struck a nerve for me. I even called the manager at EMP Billy to help me understand why their new menu is the way it is. All I got was \"they do thrive for simplicity there so the food both taste good and really focuses on that ingredient alone. \" Nothing else. okay, this is where it all went wrong. There is nothing wrong with that concept except EMP FAILED at EVERY ASPECT OF THAT CONCEPT!!!!! Sure the dishes were simple, but it was visually unappetizing and tasted flavorless and uninteresting. I don\\'t expect every dish to be plated beautifully like how most of the fine dining restaurants like to do, but I do expect every dish to taste delicious. I can\\'t believe they could ruin foie gras and truffle for me. The seared foie gras tasted like pork fat, me and my boyfriend both agreed unanimously. The lobster was chewy, the venison was under seasoned and the foie gras wrapped in middle of it was unnecessary, the diced up squid was a joke, and it\\'s pointless to go through and describe how every dish taste because they all fall under the same description: bland and unappetizing. The caviar dish was probably the only  dish that deserves a Michelin 3 star rating, and that dish was in previous tasting menus already. \\n\\nService here was good, not really warm and welcome, just good. There was several times where we waited roughly 15 minutes for our dish to arrive, where we had nothing on the table and just sat there awkwardly sipping more and more wine.  \\n\\nThere is also a no flash photography rule here:) all I wanted was a picture using my Polaroid. Not a flash photography of every dish. Sure is strict for a restaurant with no dress code. \\n\\nI am writing this to inform people do not come here at this time, maybe after they change their tasting menu again. Or else you will regret coming here and  be disappointed by \"The Best Restaurant in the world\" I honestly don\\'t think they will keep this title till next year. Or maybe do go just so you can say you dined at the best restaurant in the world before that title goes to a far away restaurant you know?\\n',\n",
       " 'I come here to celebrate my birthday. \"The Best Restaurant in the World\" So I don\\'t expect that. For the reputation of this restaurant, I expected better.

If you plan on going here, make sure you have time, it took 3-4 hours. Completely missing the Wow factor you expect as far as food is concerned. The food was even a bit boring, and monochromatic. The presentation was outstanding as well as the taste. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Service was exceptional, everyone was very friendly and from beginning to end.

Coming from Napa Valley and having experienced French Laundry, The Restaurant at Meadowood, Auberge and La Toque we were so looking forward to be amazed with Daniel Humm's culinary style. \\nInstead we left so disappointed. The first few courses were excellent ie oysters, caviar and poached lobster. After that it seemed to go down hill. Truffles overpowered every dish. The foie gras infused with what seemed to be maple syrup was a miss. The service staff seemed to be robotic. There was a long wait before they served the duck (honey and lavender glazed) dish.

Oh and almost forgot the parting gift was granola which I left on the floorboard of NYC yellow cab.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Our meal here was superb.  Flawless execution.  We like the remodel.  This is one of the finest restaurants in the world.\\n',\n",
       " \"This place has plenty of people who work here. Nice people who smile but at points can look really stressed or body guard like. But our servers were nice, the previous comment was my observations of other servers running around. Pour water nicely and place silverware and plating symmetrically. Ask any of the servers a question about the food and they'll know where it's from.\\n\\nThe 5 course:\\n\\n1.Caviar, ham, green jello, Benedict sauce, egg yolk, and homemade English muffin.\\n2. House break, tasted like croissants and the butter had cheese crumbles, that was yum.\\n3. Salad, I had ceviche, bf and his dad had the liver. We all tasted each other's, and I liked the salad the most, then ceviche, then liver. Kris (bf) said the strawberry is too strong in the liver. \\n4. Lobster claw. Very delicious!\\n5. Main dish: 2 dishes lamb and the other 2 duck breast. I love the lamb, had two different parts: one fatty and the other shredded. The duck breast was super delicious as well.\\n6. Ended with dessert: chocolate, strawberry, and cheese (goat). All separate dishes, my fav was the strawberry. \\n\\nWe didn't understand why it took roughly 15 minutes longer or shorter between dishes. Maybe space for talking? How cool would it be if there was an option to choose how fast you want the food to come out after each or when ready\\n\",\n",
       " 'We went here for lunch.  It was an unique dining experience, lasted for almost two hours.  All food items were very elegant and beautifully plated.  Ambience, Service, Food-  everything that afternoon was excellent.  It is worth every penny we spent that day.\\n',\n",
       " 'The spring/summer menu heavily features seasonal greens such as asparagus and pea. All the dishes are wonderfully arranged and presented. My favorite are the foie gras and the duck. The peppercorn & cumin seasoning for the latter is simply amazing! I casually brought up that I like mint chocolate flavor during the dessert course, and was surprised with a mint hot chocolate soon after. That was such a sweet gesture! The decor is lovely as well, and most certainly rounds out our nice experience.\\n',\n",
       " \"Review for the Summer 2016 tasting menu:\\n\\nI don't think I've ever enjoyed a dining experience as much as I've enjoyed my time at Eleven Madison Park. It is not just a meal, it is an adventure. While it's slightly standard fixtures make you wonder if this is just a normal fine dining establish, once you embark on this culinary journey, you will see that this is anything but ordinary. \\n\\nThe food is excellent. It is obvious that care and immense thought is put into every dish. If you have allergies or dietary restrictions, you will be taken care of with superb alternatives. (I would comment on the exact dishes but with the highly seasonal menu, all you really need to go know is that everything is delicious.) It is a tasting menu but you have a variety of choices as you go.\\n\\nBut the story line that is crafted alongside this dish.es is what really makes EMP an absolute must for any food lover. It's a season story that pairs well with each dish. During our summer menu, we went on a picnic (with all the proper accessories) and watched fruit be grilled in tiny barbecues. We played games with season chocolates decorated with the leaves fund in nearby Madison Square Park. Everything about the experience is what sets apart EMP from anything else I have done.\\n\\nEMP is something you have to do. Whether you are living in New York or just are visiting, experiencing EMP is worth every penny.\\n\",\n",
       " 'The restaurant, designed by Bentel & Bentel, is located in the landmark Art Deco Metropolitan Life North Building, facing Madison Square. The restaurant originally opened in 1998 and was owned by restaurateur Danny Meyer until 2011. I had my first experience at EMP in 2001. It was super expensive but so well worth it. We were seated at a table for 14 off to the side of the restaurant. Pretty private. Decor was modern and appealing. \\n\\nWine and alcohol selection superb. We tried the tasting menu. It was fantastic. Food very well prepared, high quality and plentiful. No one left hungry. Service was also good. Currently they are undergoing a renovation. Will definitely visit the newly renovated space this month once they reopen.\\n',\n",
       " 'Very good.  But I guess with all the hype, I was hoping to be wowed more than what I got... I will say a huge disappointment is the Manhattan cart.. although a great idea (similar one to rooftop bar at The  Peninsula Hotel) the bourbon, Rye and Mezcal were par for course.... I would expect EMP to have a Barrel at a major distillery as for them to add to these cocktails (and potentially sell).  I paid more than $350 per plate( not counting cocktails or wine)  which should have been $200.\\n',\n",
       " \"Servers and hosts were amazing and personable. But I'm not sure the food was worthy of being considered the best restaurant in the world. It wasn't bad by any means, it was still great. But none of the dishes made me feel like I had not had anything like that before. My wife and I both felt like some of the dishes were just slightly too salty, but this is just our tastes. The duck was my favorite dish and was fantastic. Perfectly crusted. The cocktails were also spot on. \\n\\nWe still have a lovely experience though. And I may have just set my expectations unreasonably high (being called the world's best restaurant is a blessing and a curse).\\n\",\n",
       " 'Dinner was great, but a bit lackluster for the price, when compared to our other favorite restaurant Le Bernardin. \\n\\nWhat we enjoyed:\\n\\n*\"Eggs Benedict\" caviar-- this dish got us so excited and probably raised our expectations too high\\n\\n*Honey- and lavender-glazed Duck with celery root was the most memorable dish for me (bf didn\\'t seem to agree). Even the chef says this is probably the only recipe he feels he has perfected fully.\\n\\nAnother excitement came from watching our wine bottle opened with port tongs!!\\n\\nThe rest of the meal was still great but just not as memorable...\\n\\nService was excellent!!\\n',\n",
       " \"I know what an absolute turd I sound like as some random person with no real credentials walking around giving Eleven Madison Park 2 stars out of 5 while giving some random Chinese noodle spot a 5 star... but EMP was really super duper underwhelming to the point where I wouldn't recommend it and wouldn't dine here again unless someone else was paying for it. \\n\\nMaybe part of this is also because before when I did fine dining I didn't have to pay for it but now that I have a big boy job I have to pay for it so I really feel the dent on my wallet.\\n\\nThis is a late review I came here in May with my at-the-time girlfriend.\\n\\nMy chief complaint was having to make so many choices in the tasting menu - we did the diversify the menu thing where we always try and get one of each choice. A lot of times with the choices, there was one clearly more desirable choice and one less desirable choice. Being the gentleman I was, I let my ex have the more desirable choice and I went with the less desirable choice (there was one hot foie vs cold foie option, a lobster and some lameass fish option, probably a few more)... and I was consistently disappointed by the less desirable choice. Obviously like hey dummy if you choose the less desirable choice then duh it's not going to taste as good but this is supposed to be the best restaurant in the world so I don't think I should even be in this situation. If I have to choose between dishes I should have to be torn between the choices and then be glad that I have two people so that I get to taste both options. Instead, I was just sulking eating my lame option and my ex wanted to be nice and give me some of her good option but not too much because the good option was just so much better than the lame option and she didn't want to trade any of her good food for the lame food.\\n\\nWe also didn't get the kitchen tour so idk. I would say I generally liked the wine pairing, but idk like obviously that's part of the meal but I came for the food and the food was really underwhelming.\\n\",\n",
       " 'After 4+ years of living in New York and countless restaurant experiences that ranged from the good to the bad to the ugly, I finally decided to join Yelp after eating at Eleven Madison Park.  While I don\\'t consider myself a \"foodie\" by any means, I do get to eat at the fancier NYC restaurants by virtue of my job, so I\\'d like to think I\\'m not a total rube.  I read a lot of reviews prior to going to EMP to get a better idea of what to expect, and I have to assume there is a certain degree of confirmation bias involved when reflecting on a meal that cost upwards of $500 pp, because no one wants to admit that they spent a fortune on an unremarkable experience.  EMP was certainly an experience unlike any I\\'ve ever had, but when it comes down to it the food was not outstanding and, I hate to say it... disappointing.  Leaving, I couldn\\'t name a single dish that wowed me or that left me wanting to come back.  This also may be colored by the fact that the waitstaff gave me the same feeling I get when I\\'m followed around a store (fellow people of color will know what I mean), and I\\'m also pretty sure I got food poisoning but more on that later.\\n\\nTHE GOOD:\\nThe day before our reservation, the restaurant reached out to ask if we were celebrating anything special.  We didn\\'t respond, but did share what we were celebrating and got a very cute gift related to that after our meal.\\n\\nAll of the waitstaff was super knowledgable and attentive, and answered silly questions we had about the MetLife building and what was going on at other tables.  The highlight of our night was watching the waitstaff very capably escort out a table of very drunk patrons.\\n\\nThe wine pairing was very very good, with flavors that coordinated remarkably with the food.\\n\\nThe decor and ambiance is very pretty.\\n\\nThe wine pours are heavy! I didn\\'t drink much, but definitely understood how that table got so drunk.  Plus, the last course comes with a bottle of apple brandy to drink to your heart\\'s desire.\\n\\nTHE BAD\\nI don\\'t know if we looked less affluent than the other guests (or perhaps more brown?), but every time we asked a question about what was going on at another table the servers acted like we were trying to scam our way into getting something for free.  Just expressing some curiosity! You would too if you saw the crazy stuff going on around the dining room! \\n\\nThe food seemed targeted at a non-NYC audience, with kitschy dishes like a savory black and white cookie and a play on a lox bagel in the form of a cheesecake served with caviar.  I\\'m not a fan of touristy experiences, but if you are this may be a pro.\\n\\nWhile the dishes all had unique flavors, some were outright bland.  The fluke and bass for example were really lacking in the flavor department.\\n\\nYou leave with a printed out menu and some EMP granola.  The next morning, I felt a little funny and ate some granola, thinking I was just hungry.  I then had some pretty bad stomach issues, and since everything I ate in the prior 12+ hours was from EMP I\\'m pretty sure it was something I ate.  Although I did have wine, I didn\\'t drink very much and left the dinner sober so it was not a hangover.\\n\\nOverall, if EMP is on your bucket list for the experience you should go.  But if you\\'re more concerned with food than theatre when you eat,   you can get a better meal at a peer (or even less prestigious) restaurant.  I also can\\'t shake the feeling of being othered, so if you\\'re a POC I hope you leave feeling differently, but here\\'s some fair warning that you may be looked at sideways.\\n',\n",
       " \"Just wow.\\nI've been in the hospitality industry for 17 years with the last 14 of them in management (including fine dining upper management) and I can easily without a doubt say that I was blown away by the hospitality from the staff at EMP, an experience second to none.\\nVisiting from California and having wanted to experience the famed Eleven Madison Park for quite some time(yet not having fought for a reservation a month in advance), my fiancée and I entered near the tail end of brunch just yesterday, greeted kindly by Annalisa(sp) at the door, and were allowed to sneak into the bar/lounge area for an impromptu quick bite and drink to get a peek of what they had to offer.\\n\\nOur experience was nothing short of exemplary:\\n\\nWe sat at the bar top where we were promptly greeted by L.J.(sp), one of the two bartenders for the day. He was very kind and helpfully guided us through any questions we had about the drinks and informed us of the food options available a la carte.\\nI asked about some of the spirits on the top shelf, Matt, the other bartender on, was quick to answer a few questions I had and was very friendly as well.\\n\\nWe ordered two cocktails, promptly made by L.J.. Creative ingredients, perfectly balanced with nuance and thoughtfulness, they were delicious! Quickly jumped into the highest tier of cocktails I've had NY or otherwise - and I'm an incredibly tough critic on the inside when it comes to cocktails, though I'll always be nice externally.\\n\\nWe decided to order the Steak Tartare with Foie Gras, and the Herb crusted Duck Breast to share.\\nThe tartare was served in a bone marrow presentation and entirely capped with Foie. That was easily the best steak tartare I've ever had. The accompanying bread was perfectly prepared for texture and flavor.\\nIn between courses we were served some of their bread rolls- lightly flakey yet firm, hint of cheese on top and served with their in-house cultured butter thats topped with a toasted cheese crumble and was excellent.\\nThen the duck came. Minimalist plating, duck breast alongside an onion disk that was baked with blueberries on top, then table side the accompanying sauce is added while being described to you. It was fantastic. My fiancée quickly said it was the best duck she's ever tried. I agree- it was the most elegant duck plate I've had, again very thoughtful flavor combinations with the peppercorn and coriander crust beautifully weaving through the flavor profile.\\n\\nThroughout our time at the bar top we had an excellent time chatting up L.J., he was very personable and extremely attentive. We told him much about our trip to NY and our places of interest, spoke about cocktails and the industry in general- he was very kind and accommodating. Near the end of our dish he stepped out of the bar for a moment.. didn't think much of it of course. However as soon as our dish was done we were approached by Annalisa. She kindly inquired about our experience thus far- to which our reply was of course nothing but delicious and excellent. She then asked if we would be interested in taking a tour of the newly renovated kitchen and back of house operations.. we excitedly and surprisingly obliged.\\n \\nAnnalisa guided us through the diningroom and into their back of house staging area where the final steps are put into place before items reach the tables. Then into the main kitchen area, just off to the side was a small counter set up with two settings where we were led. There we had a central look at the huge expanse of the kitchen- it was truly impressive. We were poured a small glass of water each and introduced to Keenan(sp) who was a pastry chef there. In front of us he prepared a small palate cleanser ice cream bite which was literally constructed in front of us. We were instructed to take it in a single bite- it was savory and bright. There we stayed for several minuted as Annalisa outlined the different areas and operations of the kitchen, answering any questions we had and allowing us to take it all in (it's huge.. I mean seriously huge). Afterwards we were guided through the pastry end of the kitchen and back to our bar seats. We thanked her graciously for her time and information- she was wonderful. \\n\\nNow back at the bar, a small dessert arrives for each of us from behind- completely unbeknownst to us. An elegant chocolate and coffee bite for me and a multi component raspberry & ice cream bite for her. They were both delicious and well suited for our tastes.\\n\\nMy fiancée and I look at each other and just can't believe the outstanding and wonderful experience that we've just been through from our impromptu drop-in. Never could I have imagined the level of courtesy, hospitality, respect, kindness, and genuine friendliness that we happened upon.\\n\\nL.J., Annalisa, and Matt, thank you for an unforgettable experience.\\n\\nEleven Madison Park is doing it right and doing it exceptionally well. The stars (from any and all sources) are well deserved.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Hands down best 3 star restaurant I've been to. The staff is excellent, very accommodating, and most of all friendly. Even though this is a French fine-dining establishment, it doesn't have the certain air of coldness many restaurant staff present as part of the aesthetic. The tasting menu was spectacular and just the right amount of food/spacing between proportions. Everything was perfect to the last detail; I haven't had a better dining experience anywhere else. Note: I highly recommend checking out their summer pop-up location in the Hampton's when it opens, was there last year and has the exact same standard of food in an à la carts, casual setting.\\n\",\n",
       " 'This place does not need my review but I will give it one anyway. Food was really good. Most memorably to me was the fried truffle sticks and the duck. Definitely get the duck\\n',\n",
       " \"I didn't love it here as much as I wanted to. Some of the plates were really spectacular while others were just okay. The service was absolutely amazing. The desserts were great. Baked Alaska was delicious. At the end you play a chocolate game where you match the milk (goat, cow, etc) used to each chocolate which was fun! They give you their granola at the end to go. This was probably my favorite food of the night. I wished I had loved every plate, but alas.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I have been here 6 times and i only loved it once (the first time...there was a chicken dish and it was out of this world. For the first time, i truly appreciated the existence of chicken...besides eggs. Haha.) But everytime i come back subsequently, i keep getting disappointed. I find the foods were pretty forgettable and lacking in creativity. The flavor profiles were inconsistent and temperature was lukewarm at times for some dishes. Not sure i would come back anytime soon.\\n',\n",
       " 'Do you ever find yourself eating at the #1 rated restaurant in the world, having just finished your middle course--then looking around at everyone\\'s orgasmic faces, and you\\'re wondering if they\\'re having the same meal as you because why don\\'t you too, have the same orgasmic face? \\n\\nI dined here in April 2017, just before they shut down for renovations, and they were doing the \"Best of EMP\" menu, where they showcased all the best dishes from their years of service. Imagine the \"Now That\\'s What I Call Music!\" CDs and how they highlighted the greatest hits of a certain era. It was akin to that, but only with EMP courses. And much like those CDs, I inflate my expectations that are doomed to never be met.\\n\\nThey had some GREAT dishes--the Sea Urchin, Carrot Tartare, and the Milk & Honey (although I should note that no one else shared my sentiment about that last one). The Foie Gras was the SINGLE best foie gras I\\'ve ever had--even raising a candle to ones I\\'ve had in Paris. However, I couldn\\'t help but notice some of the dishes were just so intricately executed, yet they were lacking in flavor. Here at EMP, there\\'s no such thing as \"Less is more.\" For example, the roasted suckling pig was just as good as the roast suckling pig that you can get in Chinatown for $7/lb. Also, the gastronomy-inspired Winter in Provence--was plain strange tasting. \\n\\nI will give them credit for their phenomenal service and accommodations, however. One of my dinner companions had a laundry list of allergies. The waiter patiently listened to each and every one, and assured that he too had a wonderful meal that thankfully did not trigger his untimely death. At the end of the meal, they provided parting gifts--a custom print of the menu we had, and a canister of house made granola. (The granola--I learned later, was better than my actual meal). The levels of service, execution, and poise of EMP are quite deserving of that 5 star.\\n',\n",
       " \"Sigh.  I came here again after a few years and the renovations.  We came in the winter so this review is overdue.  That day their heating wasn't working so they called to tell us to dress comfortably (I don't pay over $1000 for a dinner for 2 to wear sweats..).  We arrive and there are tiny space heaters by our feet that did nothing.  We were freezing the whole time and had to keep our coats on.  Now, I understand this stuff happens, but you would think they would at least offer you a complimentary glass of sparking or something.  Nope nothing, didn't even apologize or mention it again.\\n\\nOnto the food, perhaps again it was the heating issue, but all of the food was cold!  My duck was one of the worst ducks I've had in a long time, strangely prepared and COLD.  Literally cold when served (it was not meant to be cold..).  The rest of the food was immemorable. \\n\\nThis was my third time at EMP and we were truly disappointed.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Great Michelin 3-star restaurant. My family and I loved the caviar ham benedict. It was the perfect combination. The duck and venison were cooked to perfection.

       " \"The mixologist is on point, the staff is extremely tentative. I was there Easter weekend  and we got our dessert brought out in an Easter basket. Of course I got the cook book with the chef signature. I need to come back post restaurant renovation- it's been a year now\\n\",\n",
       " \"The experience at EMP on Sunday left my gf and me amazed!  It was her b-day and she deserved what I hoped would be a great dinner.  My only other experience with this level a restaurant was two years ago at Per Se for which I noticed some notable differences between the two.  The cost of the tasting menus and quality of food was comparable, however, the latter upcharged a couple extras such as black truffle and caviar...this is why we will only be going back there once in a blue moon as the menus are expensive enough as it is.  EMP offered a very balanced 8-10 course tasting menu with courses that included black truffle and caviar at no extra charge...it was a better value, which is why we will be going back for my b-day and probably a couple more times in addition to that since their menu changes 4 times a year, according to the manager.  We had 9 courses and picked different selections.  Each one stood out...our favorites were the dosa accompanied with potato salad and black truffle, souffle with caviar, halibut, lobster, veal, duck, and the surprising tasty golden oyster mushroom.\\n\\nAdditional notes on the staff involved Bridget, one of the maitre d's, emailing a greeting a week or two prior and inquiring if there were any needs/requests from me.  Upon arrival, there she was greeting us and leading us to the bar for cocktails while the floor staff was huddling before opening the dining floor (we were a few minutes early), which is not uncommon, but I just was not expecting her to be greeting us as we entered.  Rather, I was expecting to check in at the host's counter and then wait to be seated like at any other restaurant.  Additionally, I was surprised that she remembered my name from our emails...evidently, she made mental notes of the night's guestlist beforehand, which added a personal touch...there was no looking up my name on a computer screen (well, at least not in our presence).  Regarding the service, Bridget ensured the floor staff was aware of my gf's b-day and food allergies because they all acknowledged those 2 facts throughout the dinner, during which we did not have to ask for anything (eg. napkins and water).  Regarding the food, Blair periodically checked on us throughout the 2.5 - 3 hour tasting menu and provided details on the sources of the ingredients in our dishes, which came mostly from NYS and other northeastern states. Additionally, the servers were courteous and also informative about the dishes they were serving.  At the end, Blair provided a small gift bag for the b-day comprising of lists of what we both ate along with jars of restaurant-made granola.  Further, Harry, who I believe was the manager, stopped by and asked how the dinner was, which is not out of the ordinary save for the fact that he also expressed interest in knowing what our favorite dishes were and why.  In light of the above, we left very impressed with the intention of spending our hard-earned money at EMP again.  Many thanks to EMP and looking forward to seeing you again!\\n\",\n",

The staff is extremely friendly and want to make sure you have a genuinely fantastic experience. Having been to other 3 michelin star restaurants including Le Bernardin (which was also amazing), what sets apart Eleven Madison park is the warm and friendly staff who make you feel like family. \\n\\nThe food is exceptional. We went just in time for the fall menu and we devoured every single item in the almost 10 course meal. They really space apart the courses, so you never feel rushed to finish any meal. We really enjoyed speaking to several staff members especially the connoisseur Erica who was lovely and very informative. The staff also took us on a tour of the kitchen and we were given delicious, warm cider during the tour. Towards the end of our meal, they offered us brandy and choclate covered pretzels which were delicious. They also gave each of us a souvenir or breakfast granola in a jar along with a customized menu of everything we ordered for the meal.\\n\\nThis was, by far, the best dining experience of my life and we will definitely come back to celebrate yet another milestone in our lives.

Everything we picked was absolutely delicious! \\n-You will not leave hungry! While the portions are fairly small, the number of courses will fill you up. We actually couldn\\'t eat the final chocolate pretzel course because we were so full. Anyone who tells you they left hungry is either lying or eats an abnormally large amount of food on a regular basis. \\n-If you get up to go to the bathroom you may delay your upcoming course. They will not \"drop\" food if someone has walked away from the table. And if that delay causes the food to be less than perfect, you may be waiting for a while so that they can get the food back to perfection. \\n-The entire experience took about three hours. Relax, enjoy the experience, and plan to be there for a while. \\n-At the end of your meal you get a gift.

A Don Draper/Miles Davis/Ernest Hemingway-liberating-the-bar-at-the-Ritz-Hotel-in-the-Place-Vendome level of cool.  Go.  Eat.  Transcend.  It will be the type of meal you speak about years from now in hushed tones.  If Heaven has a restaurant, it is Eleven Madison Park.\\n\",\n",

The entire experience made for fun evening outs. This time, however,y sister was in town and wanted to go - but we hadn't made the much-needed far in advance reservations. We showed up around 7:30p (they open at 5p) and we were able to grab two seats at the bar! The menu is an abbreviated tasting menu (I believe 5 courses but they added things here and there so felt almost like 7) and it was perfect. The bartender was amazing - paired great wine and drinks with each course, friendly and fun. It was such a relaxed yet exquisite meal. I highly recommend if you don't have reservations and are willing to roll the dice - try eating at the bar! If not - there are great restaurants in the neighbor to substitute with...\\n\",\n",
       " \"We came here for dinner this past weekend. It has been a few years since we've been here but remembered how creative in taste and presentation it was, so was really excited. They also reno the restaurant last summer so curious how it looked.  The restaurant appearance seems a bit more simplistic than before but when you have super high ceilings, column-free, and large windows like that I guess not much needs to be done.  The service was near impeccable. A couple of times when we returned to the table there should have been someone to pull the table out to let my partner back into the seat.  The food, which included lobster,lamb and duck, was very good but fell short of expectations. Nothing really blew us away - taste or presentation. And if you don't eat any bread, which is excellent, one might not feel very full.  FYI - they no longer have the Gruyere Gougeres (we call it cheese puffs) so that was disappointing.  We ordered 3 wines by the glass that went well with the meal so likely a better option than the $175 wine pairing for many wines you might not be familiar with or varietals and blends you dont care for.  We went to Jean George last year and to us that was more of a Michelin 3-star worthy/top rated restaurant in the world experience.  We also went to Le Cinq (also top Michelin rated) in Paris last year and that was a superior gastro experience to Eleven Madison and worthy of the price and accolades, so make sure you reserve early if you plan on going there.  We'll go back to Le Cinq and Jean George. Eleven Madison, maybe we'll go back again in a few years.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Eleven Madison Park pre-renovation used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the world. I was excited to return to Eleven Madison Park post-renovation, especially with its newly appointed status as the world\\'s best restaurant. Also exciting me was that this would be my 50th Michelin Star restaurant visit, so it felt appropriate that the grandest restaurant of them all would be the destination for this occasion. Previously, I had loved the menu, but found service and ambiance too stiff. With this visit, I was pleased to find a new casual vibe to the whole experience, but with all the magic lost from the food.\\n\\nThe Good: \\n- Service is now much more casual and friendly compared to my previous visit, and the new dining room is beautiful. I love the more relaxed environment. \\n- Standout dishes were the taste of spring appetizers and the duck. Both were very well prepared and tasty dishes.\\n- The team prepared a special gift for my new job, which was very cute and much appreciated!\\n\\nThe Not So Good: \\n- Everything I loved about the previous Eleven Madison Park food-wise has been lost. The whimsy and fun that made this restaurant special-- the carrot grinder, pretzel basket, etc.-- is completely gone, as if this is a whole different restaurant completely. The menu now feels a lot more traditional in its technique and focus, and is a lot more heavy overall despite having a lot less courses than the previous iteration of Eleven Madison Park. Presentation was lacking in my opinion.\\n- Some dishes were really a miss for me unfortunately. Three people at my table deemed the goat cheese dessert inedible because the pungent flavor. The main course of snails and morels also had an unappealing flavor, akin to \"dirt\" by one person at my table. The lobster was tough and chewy, and the savory desserts were an unappealing end to such a heavy menu. \\n- Service lapses. Though the service is (at times overly) friendly, there were a lot of service lapses that you shouldn\\'t be seeing at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant, let alone the World\\'s Best Restaurant. My water was frequently switched between sparkling and still, despite a reminder that I ordered sparkling. Chairs were not pulled out when returning to the table, and one time my napkin wasn\\'t even folded when leaving the table. Dishes were served to the wrong people at the table twice, and plates were not set nor taken in synchronicity. Servers also stumbled over their words quite a bit; we\\'re all human, but that is not quite the level of polish you\\'d expect here. Now, I know some of these things sound like pretentious quips, but these are things you\\'d expect to operate flawlessly as this caliber of restaurant and it\\'d be unfair to not point it out. \\n- I have some more subjective issues with the visit as well. You now have to make decisions on what you want for 4 courses, and I think it\\'d be a lot easier to provide some sort of menu for these choices instead of a waiter verbally presenting them because it\\'s hard to digest (no pun intended) that many choices. Service was also overly compensating at times, as mentioned above. I love friendly and personable service, but there was a lack of the traditional professionalism I\\'d expect to see at this caliber of restaurant. \\n\\n\\nOverall, I was disappointed in my visit to Eleven Madison Park. I have such fond memories of my previous visit, and although I love and embrace changes and evolutions to restaurants, I wouldn\\'t even consider this the same restaurant as pre-renovation Eleven Madison Park. The food was the most disappointing aspect; even if it is not my preferred style of food, there were too many objective issues with the food as listed above. Service was really friendly, but it pales in comparison objectively to my other 3-Michelin Star experiences with all the misses mentioned above. Unfortunately, I will not be returning any time soon. \\n\\nAmbiance: 8/10\\nService: 6/10\\nFood: 4/10\\n\\nOverall: 6/10\\n',\n",

       " 'Note: This is not a review on the food - I thought it was amazing and I loved every bite. This is more a review of the experience, which is really what everyone is looking for when they go to this type of restaurant. And I just don\\'t see how EMP won best in the world, given this experience.  \\n\\nAfter being named best in the world, the expectations are much higher for EMP than other 3 star Michelin restaurants. I went in expecting more than I had ever received, which I feel like everyone does at EMP. It\\'s not even the cost that makes you expect more, but the reputation it\\'s built. Unfortunately, I\\'ve been to 1 stars that provided better service and a more memorable experience. Maybe we hit a bad night, but I didn\\'t think that was possible. See below for additional detail. \\n\\nI have heard amazing things about EMP for the last several years, and it\\'s been on my bucket list for a while. Rather than take a vacation or go somewhere out of town, my wife and I decided to do a \"staycation\" for our first anniversary and celebrate it at EMP. Since we had also booked a weekend stay at the St. Regis, we coordinated with the Concierge to help make the dinner as special as possible (assuming they could call the restaurant and help make it perfect). \\n\\nRather than type an overly wordy review, I want to be very clear about the night and why I\\'m choosing to give it a 2 star review. I thought the food was delicious, and everything I\\'d expect from the best restaurant in the world. However, outside of the food, my expectations were not even close to being met. I\\'ll explain below:\\n\\n- By far the worst and most disappointing part of the night is that they completely forgot our desert course. They literally brought the check before we had finished the meal. To remedy, the decided to \"comp\" the coffee we ordered. Seems like much more could have been done than saving the cost of 2 coffees. \\n - The restaurant did nothing special to indicate they knew it was our anniversary. This is fine overall, except the expectation is that they go above and beyond for everyone else, and the St. Regis concierge told us we would receive a special table, given a tour of the kitchen and more. \\n- They did not ask us about wine or drinks at all. This was very surprising, given our previous experiences at other Michelin star restaurants. It\\'s shocking to not be given a wine menu or asked if we wanted to do the wine tasting (which we certainly did).\\n- I\\'ve been to other 3 star restaurants and have been blown away with the wine tastings, but this tasting menu left me disappointed with the variety and quality\\n- Our friend ordered us a bottle of champagne and they forgot to give us half of it until we specifically asked at the end of the night where it went\\n- There was a couple seated next to us who were immediately taken to the kitchen for a tour, and seemed to be much more important than us. I\\'m surprised to see that type of preference at this type of restaurant.\\n\\nWe had the St. Regis Concierge call the next day for us, and they acted like nothing had happened and even tried to say they had given us champagne for the anniversary. We knew they only provided what our friend had arranged for us, so very weird they would try to act like something more happened. \\n\\nI would just expect a flawless meal, and I have heard of all other experiences being flawless. However, we did not receive the same flawless meal as everyone else, which is quite disappointing for the now fourth best restaurant in the world.\\n',\n",

But maybe my observations can help future potential diners, before they plunk down more than a half-grand (for two) on dinner ...\\nFirst of all, I got our rezzies (6:30p for two on a Saturday in late March), by literally waiting at the computer for the 9 am table release, as if I were buying concert tickets. So there\\'s that.\\nOur experience began before the date, with an e-mail from EMP, looking to confirm, and personalize, our meal. I responded with a paragraph about our backgrounds (he did ask ...) and why we were dining there (10th wedding anniversary). I got a polite reply e-mail.\\nThe information I shared was peppered by our waiter into his conversations with us during our meal. It was a cute touch, but felt a little ... artificial?\\nAs we approached, the building, and the room, could not have been more stately. I\\'m a sucker for limestone, and also for art deco design, so I was gaga. I was not gaga for our greeter, who was warm, effusive, and prone to open-armed gestures as if he were going for a hug. Hey, I\\'m cool with hugs, but not if that\\'s not your intent ... the service from everyone over the night was similar. They didn\\'t take themselves too seriously, but there was more than a hint of ... awkwardness? It could very well be that *I* was the awkward, nervous one, and they were trying to deal with me. Entirely possible. Almost ... likely ...\\nAs for the rest of the design elements, nothing was left to chance. Even the banquettes had pillows between the diners, as a kind of visual break. Nice touch. Some two-tops were sat across from each other, some, side-by-side. It was clear that that this was for traffic flow, but side-by-side eating can be awkward for some ...\\nThe final design element I wanted to mention was the working rotary phone near the bathrooms. It\\'s old-school and awesome, and I loved it.\\nI got the wine pairing - I appreciated the thought that went into the selections, especially for going local with New York wines (I loved the Empire Estate dry riesling).\\nSo, the food. Portion size was an issue on some things, like the lobster, and the flambéed Alaska (where the heck did the rest of it go?). But generally, the food was impeccable, and in some cases, transformative. The duck - after the duck at EMP, I don\\'t remember eating any duck before it, nor do I think I can ever eat duck ever again. It will never even approach what EMP served me. The same for the foie gras, and the parsnips, surprisingly. Those parsnips blew me away.\\nWife had a similar experience. She loves mushrooms, and they redefined mushrooms for her.\\nThe \"New York\" touches were cute - the \"black and white\" savory cookie to start, and the \"eggs benedict\" caviar (though I wanted to taste more of the caviar - if I\\'m eating caviar, I want to know it).\\nI really appreciated the final course, the \"name that milk\" game, where different chocolates were made (by Mast) with different animal milks. Though I failed that game, I definitely picked out the funky, grassy, or mild notes in the chocolate. Fun and also educational.\\nThe reason I can remember the meal so well is because they print up personalized menus at the end of the meal! God, how long have I wanted this. A record of what I ate! So impressive.\\nAs impressive as waiting at the door with your coat without having a coat check ticket. The only way they can pull that off is by paying close attention, which was a recurring theme through the night.\\nFinally, the parting gift - the container of granola! I snacked on it all week, that stuff was crack.\\nEleven Madison Park gave us the best meal of our lives (sorry, Gramercy Tavern). I expected an outstanding meal, and I received one.\\nI\\'d go back in a heartbeat, esp. if someone else were paying ...\\n',\n",

       " 'Remember that movie Pleasantville?  It\\'s from the 90s.  All the residents from some town are in this black and white world and everyone thinks that the black and white life is fine and dandy.  Then some random guy gets puked on by a rainbow and brings color to the world and the townsfolk realize what they\\'ve been missing all along. Not familiar?  Admittedly, I\\'ve never seen the movie; so the above plot summary is entirely fabricated.  However, my experience at EMP is what I imagine those poor schmucks in Pleasantville experienced when they finally looked up at the world and saw things in vivid vibrant color.  I thought I knew what eating good food was like, and then I had EMP. \\n\\nI\\'m a pretty seasoned eater.  I celebrate chefs like normal people celebrate Beyonce.  I hope someday to leave a bloated happy corpse full of foie gras and butter.  I\\'ve had Michelin starred restaurants around the world and this place blew them all out of the water.  \\n\\nThe decor is tasteful and inviting but not pretentious.  Fluffy pillows on benches, cozy nooks, beautiful linens, and amazing flower arrangements greet you as you walk in.  The lighting is warm and welcoming as the ambiance strikes that perfect balance between casual and upscale.  \\n\\nThe service is everything you\\'d expect from the no. 3 restaurant in the world: fast, attentive, gracious, and friendly.  Our server was incredibly kind and put up with our selfies, questions, requests for information and clarification, and even shared some personal anecdotes -- which made the setting feel even more relaxed.  The sommelier hit it out of the park when my friend asked for a \"funky strong fruity wine like they have in South Africa.\"  A gorgeous Australian(?) chef came out and prepared a dish tableside (I almost tried to marry him as he was plating my lobster).  The human element at EMP was a perfectly balanced whirling dervish of style, panache, and hospitality.  \\n\\nNow to the food.  God the food.  Chef Humm really knows how to work his flavors.  Less restrained than a more traditional fine dining establishment like Le Bernadin, EMP throws out bold combinations of flavors and textures, beautiful tableside presentations, and a sense of creatively with the dishes that makes you feel like the kitchen would be a really fun place to work.  \\n\\nWe opened with a gorgeous black and white savory cookie.  Hints of apple and cheddar with a rich, flaky, crumbly texture.  Delicious and the perfect way to start the meal off. \\n\\nNext, the sexy Australian chef comes out with a multi tiered rack of small appetizers.  All vegetable based and presented beautifully; each bite was a celebration of the distinct flavors of its star vegetable.\\n\\nThere are several amazing courses which I have to skip over b/c of character limits on these reviews (The sexy chef is nowhere to be found during these courses.  I assume it\\'s because he is planning our courtship).  They are all very, very good.  Trust me.  \\n\\nMy favorite dish of the night is EMPs take on Eggs Benedict.  Small tins of egg yolk, ham and caviar are served alongside a quartet of adorable tiny biscuits.  I could eat a wheelbarrow full of this stuff.  The egg yolk and caviar is rich and unctuous with smoky ham flavor; and the biscuits are light and fluffy with just enough crunch on the crust so that you have that element of textural interest in the mouthfeel. \\n\\nLater in the meal, Sexy Chef returns with a large broiler pan filled with lobsters, clams, fennel, seaweed, and FIRE (the showmanship!).   I lose myself in my husband to be\\'s eyes (and accent) as he pours a flask of fragrant white wine into the pan; and I\\'m swept away in the aromatics of the fennel and the wine as a cloud of steam wafts up.  My future husband then takes the broiler away.  We almost have our first fight.  He soon brings the lobster back on a plate and we make up.  The lobster is served with an amazingly complex and delicate Uni mayonnaise and some kind of sauce made up of lobster juice and magic. \\n\\nOne last highlight was from another \"choose your own adventure\" course. A choice btw a sweet potato with apple or butternut squash and bone marrow.  I pick squash and my outraged companion chastises me for being from Texas and rejecting a sweet potato when there\\'s one offered.  I do not regret my choice.  The smokey richness and umami of the bone marrow plays perfectly with the sweetness of the squash.  Her sweet potato is perfectly cooked with a crispy outer skin and a beautifully pillowy interior. My companion eats large bites of my squash and I try not to stab her hand with my fork.  \\n\\nAs the evening progresses, there are more courses, amazing tea, decadent cheeses, and a very high stakes chocolate game at the end; all of which must be omitted for brevity\\'s sake.  If I were so allowed, this review would go on for ages, but it\\'s likely most of you have already stopped reading.  In closing, start saving your pennies and find the time to come here.  You won\\'t regret it\\n',\n",

       " 'KenScale: 9.0/10\\n\\nRecently, I got engaged to my girlfriend. We chose her ring together but I wanted to pop the question when she didn\\'t expect it. In the course of my planning for the \"engagement ceremony,\" I thought about which restaurant I should take her to after I propose to her. As someone who has been living in New York City for close to 11 years, she has been to many restaurants in the city. I somehow remembered though that she said she hadn\\'t been to Eleven Madison Park yet, and also knowing that the restaurant is shutting down for renovations in the summer, I knew this was the perfect venue to have an engagement dinner. I had an unbelievable meal on my visit a couple of years ago, where the creativity of dishes combined with careful execution and commitment to fresh ingredients really showed why EMP is one of the best restaurants in the world. How did our engagement dinner stack up against my previous visit? The menu has gotten shorter (more like 8-10 compared to close to 20 last time) and the dishes have become somewhat more predictable (no more asparagus cooked inside a cow bladder!), but we still had an amazing meal.\\n\\nAfter a celebratory champagne, we were served with an assortment of bites. Among those, my favorite was celery root with black truffle and parsnip pie, and my girlfriend also enjoyed rutabaga with celery and walnuts. Just like last time, the restaurant served caviar in a playful take on egg\\'s benedict; it was still as amazing as I had remembered, with the combination of caviar, diced ham and pickled egg yolk displaying so much wonderful complexity in flavor. For the starter course, I went with foie gras seared with maple and apple, while my girlfriend went to scallop marinated with leek and potato. Foie gras had silky smooth texture that I very much enjoyed even though I\\'m not really a foie gras person, and a bite of scallop that I stole from my girlfriend also had elegant balance of texture. One of the best dishes during our meal was the lobster. After the servers brought forward a long rectangular \"pan\" where the lobster was being smoked and steamed, we got to taste an amazingly chewy piece of lobster that I marveled at what kind of trick the kitchen pulled to achieve this textural excellence. The vegetable dishes that followed were also outstanding. I was more partial to the squash roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds for the way the squash really just melted in my mouth, but sweet potato smoked with mustard seeds and apple wasn\\'t far behind in deliciousness. For the main dish, we both ordered the magnificently cooked duck glazed in honey and lavender and accompanied by onion and plum. My girlfriend, who is very partial to duck meat, absolutely enjoyed this beautiful piece of meat, which was even better with the side dishes of brussels sprouts and parsnip. The weakest part of the meal was in the cheese course. I just wish the kitchen put together fondue in its standard format instead of putting it inside baked potato that quickly overwhelmed the cheese\\'s flavor. The desserts that came after, however, were much better. I could have the delightful apple poached with buckwheat toffee cake and apple sorbet every day for its elegant flavor without being too sweet, and chestnut cheesecake with sweet potato custard and chestnut honey ice cream was also quite delicious. The meal ended with a little game where we got to match four different varieties of chocolate with four different animals from which the taste of chocolate came from. Unfortunately, we only got one right...\\n\\nI didn\\'t realize until I booked the table for our engagement that EMP has switched to a ticket system (similar to how other fine dining restaurants like Alinea in Chicago do these days). In other words, you pay up front for your meal, so make sure to find a commitable date that you can book. We both really enjoyed a fine cabernet bottle from Napa (where we are actually planning to have a wedding too!) to complement our meal. Services at EMP were still as outstanding as I remembered it. I\\'m really glad that our engagement dinner was a memorable evening, with awesome food, wine and services. Let KenScale\\'s culinary journey continue, this time with soon to be my life partner!\\n',\n",
       " 'My best dining experience ever. Everything was near perfect if I can\\'t say it\\'s perfect! \\n\\nOyster poached and raw with chestnut and veloute was my favorite. The raw oyster with apple meat and vinegar like sauce was my one-bite organismic wonder! It\\'s refreshing with the slightly sour dressing and fruity apple aroma. Everything together taste amazing, icy fresh with a fruity finish. The warm oyster is on the other hand, rich, creamy and delicious.\\n\\nCaviar - mini Benedict with egg, potato, and ham. Very cute, mint bite size muffins. We need to assemble them ourselves which was another fun part of the meal! \\n\\nEMP def masters the cooking of seafood - no matter it\\'s the crab or the lobster, the meat is juicy, super tender and soft (mind-blowing)! I can\\'t imagine the lobster can be as tender as this! \\n\\nCelery root - never had celery this flavorful before.\\n\\nDuck - another my favorite dish. Two weeks old honey and lavender glazed duck coated in cumin spices with Juicy meat and fatty skin. Duck soup - salty and rich.\\n\\nCheese plate was extraordinary too. Amazing presentation - tarte with Apple skin that filled with cheddar.\\n\\nAfter our cheese plate, we were invited to the famous kitchen tour! it was mind blowing to walk into the world classic restaurant\\'s kitchen!! There we shaked hands Chef Will!! We were also greeted by other chefs and got our complimentary maple syrup refreshment coated with Apple meat. The waitress kindly offered to take photo for us. I mentioned that my cell was running out of battery so we used my friends\\'. When we returned to our table 5 minutes later, I found a wireless charger on the table!! I didn\\'t even notice when she mentioned this to another staff! The service was absolutely impeccable.\\n\\nBaked Alaska was a great show!\\n\\nLastly, we had a lot of fun in the \"name the milk\" chocolate milk guessing game. And deeply enjoyed the last bites of chocolate pretzel with sea salt.\\n\\nTo end the will-never-end-memory-creating night, everything was perfect. EMP - thanks very much for the absolutely fun, amazing, delicious and inspiring dining experience.\\n',\n",
       " \"I came to EMP on my first trip to NYC, to celebrate many occasions (two birthdays and an anniversary to be exact)! We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal. We left very satiated with no regrets. \\n\\nThe ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost, it was worth it, but only for a nice occasion. Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night - absolutely not. And for the high cost, was everything done impeccably? Close, but not quite. I've had equally great food at a lower price point (eg, $150 pp vs $300 pp), but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service. There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about. Napkins were folded, surfaces cleaned, shawls were delivered (for us perpetually shivering ladies!), and tablecloths were ironed (literally!). In terms of the food, at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars, I really expected to be WOW'd by every single dish. Unfortunately, this was just not the case. \\n\\nSTANDOUTS: \\n- Starter bites: compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble. Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras?! \\n- Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar: this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper! it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks. Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers. \\n- Seared warm foie gras dish with beets: This course was presented with various other options (clams with fennel, mushroom carpaccio, or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage). I ended up choosing the clams, but this to me was the CLEAR winner. I would try to explain all the components of the dish, but frankly I am not sure (aside from the beets, there was a crunch component), and it was just indescribable. This is hands down one of the best things I've ever tasted! \\n- Roasted duck with honey and lavender: beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe. The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish. \\n\\nCOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT:\\n- Starter bites: sweet potato tart. They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us, but honestly it was a very sad, black sheep version. I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato. \\n- Clams with fennel: while visually beautiful and labor intensive, I just found the taste to be one note: surfer clams, with clam mouse, and dill. It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture. \\n- Kale seasonal side with egg yolk: There was something underneath the kale (perhaps a kale puree) that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture. Honestly, I wasn't sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate. \\n- Wine pairings: Unfortunately, we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around. \\n\\nFor the experience as a whole (food, service, kitchen tour), we had a great night. But for the overall bill, it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved. For $300 a person, I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improved/elevated (lovely, just not something I would expect at this pricepoint). However, the personalization and take home gifts were certainly nice touches and I would absolutely recommend EMP to everyone looking to have a nice night out.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Eleven Madison Park lived up to the hype. I have never experienced such an attentive and psychic staff.  They must have a crystal ball because all of our needs were met even before we thought to ask.  \\n\\nFor example, the staff would refresh our beverage pairings even if we only had a bite of a course left to finish.  We also asked a question about dining etiquette, in return we received a professionally hand drawn tutorial from their \"in-house artist\"...what does that even mean!\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were also impressed with the food and narrative behind each dish.  I\\'m very excited to return after the restaurant goes through their remodel.\\n',\n",

I recommend coming right when they open. You get there before the rush and will have a nice view of the dining room where you can people watch. And you'll still get the impeccable service at a fraction of the time you would have spent there.\\n\\nYou won't have access to the full menu but you'll still be able to choose from a select menu of some their best dishes. \\n\\nPlease order yourself\\u200b a drink or two because it's gonna be amazing.

With a six hour time difference, making a reservation was a challenge, but it's such a pleasure and an amazing experience though, with some of the friendliest and efficient staff around. No wonder, you guys are still number one in the country. Food was just marvelous! With a penchant for cheese, I was simply blown away and excited for any dish that had them. Even for hubby who was not a cheese person, he was very impressed too! The superb use of ingredients was just exemplary! The portions too were just perfect that every course/dish was simply enjoyable! Special kudos to Jenny Escalante, whose expertise and excellence was admirable! Would love to go back!\\n\",\n",

Overall, it deserves its spot on the top 50 restaurants in the world. I have been following this list for years and would say at number one, I have yet gone to a restaurant that's beat it!\\n\",\n",
       " \"I had the greatest meal of my life at Eleven Madison Park. I also had the second greatest here. I also had a disastrous one that featured lame table-side magic and a carrot grinder.\\n\\nBut I'm pleased to say that the restaurant has nearly returned to its past glory. Our latest meal still didm't quite include those one-bite orgasmic wonders of their first menus, but every course was a home run, and the service was impeccable--perfectly timed, efficient, flexible, welcoming and friendly.\\n\\nHighlights of our most recent meal included an assortment of delicious oyster preparations (high praise since I'm not a huge oyster fan); caviar served like miniature eggs benedict that you assemble yourself; a wonderful sea bass; celery root cooked in a pig's bladder; and a chocolate guessing game for dessert.\\n\\nThey have started opening their older wines with port tongs, which may be a bit over the top but does provide an entertaining table-side show, and it certainly gets rid of any cruddy corks!\\n\\nThe biggest change is that instead of 16 or so mini courses there are now eight somewhat larger ones, and many course offer several selections. This allowed us, as a party of three, to sample nearly everything on the menu.\\n\\nI like this new format, and the more professional level of the service overall. Say a happy goodbye to the magic show, and give it a fresh try.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Well, well, well. \\n\\nAfter all the hype, fanfare and expectations, the #1 restaurant in the world did live up to its name. The service -- from warm email exchanges in the days leading up to the dinner, to the way the staff bade us farewell -- was simply exceptional. Über-professional-but-never-arrogant, the staff made us feel at ease. \\n\\nI'm a foodie with very high expectations for creativity and plating, and EMP did not disappoint. The 11-course retrospective was a great and actually economical way to enjoy the culinary hits of the last decade, without having to shell out a small fortune each year.\\n\\nThe cocktails were refined, complex and beautiful. Photogenic like whoa! Still, I took only a few photos, and did so quietly and quickly so as not to ruin the elevated ambience of the whole experience. \\n\\nThe food was stunning, precise, colorful and inventive and, as a geeky bonus, some of it reminded me of my own amateur gastronomical experiments from years past.\\n\\nThis is my kind of place. I have no dietary restrictions, and I often loathe having to make a decision at fine restaurants (where everything is delicious). I'm all about maximizing diversity of flavors and textures, so the pre-determined tasting menu was ideal.\\n\\nMy guest and I were there for a special occasion, and we got a mini-tour of the kitchen, along with a cocktail made on the spot using liquid nitrogen -- a fun interlude. All the while I was mesmerized by how organized the kitchen was. Insanely organized. Not like what you see in kitchens on TV, where chaos often reigns.\\n\\nWhen you consider how many people are employed here, and the cost of rent/decor/food procurement, the price of the dinner starts to make sense.\\n\\nMost of the FOH staff we spoke to had been working there for 5+ years, a clear and powerful testament to the venue and its ability to retain loyal talent. Where do you go from the top restaurant on Earth? Maybe Mars... Elon Musk is planning something, I'm sure... but is Wylie Dufresne available and willing? \\n\\nI'm not exactly a wealthy man, so it'll be a while before I can return to EMP for a full dinner service (and they're closing for renovation anyway), but I look forward to seeing how they reinvent themselves in the years ahead.\\n\\nNo real downsides. A single typo in/on the cocktail menu was appropriately handled by the server and bar manager (#sorrynotsorry, I'm a grammar fiend!). Happy to help with copywriting/copyediting when the restaurant comes out with new menus! ;-)\\n\\nPriceless. Worth every penny! \\n\\nThank you to Matthew P, Dmitri M, Mark W, Sarah Van D, Charlie B, Chris A, Leo R, Sara(h) the Commis/Liquid Nitrogen Queen, Captain Steven/Stephen, and the countless other teammates who made all of this possible. Y'all are incredible, particularly because you execute this every night without appearing bored.\\n\\nIn my native tongue: dzięki.\\n\",\n",

       " 'A real experience. Amazing service, the food was fantastic and it is real artistry and pursuit of perfection. Hard to put a $ value on it but we pay $500+ pp for certain Broadway tix so everything can be justified. We did the paired wines and truly experienced some vino that was fantastic, paired beautifully with the food and was different than what we would normally order.\\n',\n",
       " 'EMP has always been held in high regard by any food lover -- and even so much more after being named #1 in the world for 2017.  I liked the ambiance as it was not too dark or quiet.  The service was amazing as to be expected.  Much thought was given to the presentation of the food too.  This creativity was shown from the second we sat down.  \\n\\nThe first course was a surprise -- caviar and accompaniments hidden in wrapped boxes, waiting to be open.  We really enjoyed the presentation and the caviar proved to be one of our favorite courses.  The rest of the food, however, did not really live up to hype.  I wished the creativity carried over to the flavors of the remaining dishes.  While the dishes tried to bring new flavors to life (e.g., foie gras and beets, pumpkin with seaweed and bacon, etc.), the blending of some of the ingredients just did not flow.  \\n\\nShould you try it out?  Sure.  \\nIs it the best restaurant in the world in my book?  No.\\nBut, who am I?  Just a hungry guy willing to pay to be enlightened.\\n',\n",
       " \"This is an elegant restaurant. I'm not sure what it looked like before their renovation last summer, but currently the place is very quaint with it's large windows along the side, and otherwise minimalist decor.  I came here in late winter, so it got dark early, but I imagine during the summer months, the dining hall overall would be very well lit for most of the dinner service.\\n\\nOverall the food here was fantastic. Each dish I had was going to highlight a specific flavor / texture of what was served.  For the dishes, there were no specific guidelines as to how we should best consume the food, we were just served and let be. For the tasting menu here, there are a couple of times where we were given an option to choose what we would like to have. My favorite dish of the evening was the Dry-Aged Duck, and is still the best duck I've had to date. After the entrees, and as part of dessert, we were given this bottle of Apple Brandy. If i recall, i was free to drink as much as i wanted, but be warned, it's quite strong.\\n\\nUnfortunately did not get the wine pairing, but there is a full bar, where you can order something off their menu or go for the option where you tell your server what alcohols / flavors you like and the bartender will try to create something that suits your tastes. \\n\\nAfter dinner, you get the option to tour the kitchen, and on the way out as you collect your bags / coat, you're given a container of their house made granola as well as a menu documenting your dishes of the evening.\\n\",\n",
       " \"My husband surprised me with reservations to EMP for Valentine's Day this year. Needless to say, I was ecstatic at the prospect of dining at not only the best restaurant in America, but the #3 restaurant in the world! Having dined at many other high-end restaurants I was excited, but also nervous, about not wanting to be let down with lofty expectations. However, from the moment we stepped into EMP, our magical evening began on a great foot by the immaculate decor and the impeccable service.\\n\\nWe opted for a 5 course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings for our Valentine's Day meal. My husband had surprised me with an all-Riesling wine pairing (my favorite wine), which was an added bonus! Some of the Rieslings that were part of this pairing ranged  from $150/bottle-over $400/bottle, so you can imagine how delicious and wonderfully paired our meal was. Onto the food, which was quite possibly, the most flavorful meal I've ever had. What I enjoyed most about the vegetarian tasting menu was that the food may have looked somewhat simple at first glance, but once you took a bite of food, you quickly realized how much complexity and depth of flavors and textures was hidden in every bite. I absolutely loved the cauliflower play on caviar, the sweet potato with jus, the kohlrabi salad, and the mushroom risotto! \\n\\nThere were also small touches that made the experience extremely personalized and distinguished it from other high-end restaurants, such as, the private tour of the kitchen, complete with a cocktail, the sea salt pretzel and cocktail at the end of the meal, and the granola parting gift (best granola ever!!). \\n\\nMy husband and I have already decided we are going to be back for the 10-12 course pairing menu the next time we're in NYC!\\n\",\n",
       " 'It is very hard to label a single meal in one\\'s life as \"the best.\" Some days, I might feel that the best meal I\\'ve ever had was at a taco truck in Ensenada, and other days I might think that it was a five star restaurant in San Francisco. I have a little philosophy: a filet mignon and a hot dog are different but equal pleasures. That being said, was this meal the best I\\'ve ever had? Probably not, but it\\'s certainly a contender. Was this meal worth the price tag though? Absolutely. Would I do it again? Most definitely. Do I understand why this is considered the best restaurant in the country? Yes, it certainly deserves the praise it receives.\\n\\nWhat was most incredible about Eleven Madison Park was that every single bite was utter perfection; nothing missed the mark in any way, and every single component of each plate was immaculate in itself, right down to the tiny garnish of marinated celery. Furthermore, at Eleven Madison Park, foods that I usually don\\'t care for were suddenly remarkable, and were equally as good as my favorites.\\n\\nI asked for a vegan menu, and they graciously catered to my needs. And trust me, vegans aren\\'t missing anything with the menu here. I dare say that my carnivorous friend was the one missing out.\\n\\nChef Daniel Humm\\'s creations were somewhat of enigmas. Here, something as boring as a carrot had an unbelievable amount depth, and something as simple as a potato was prepared to be an utterly complex journey of taste. Humm\\'s dishes truly showed a mastery for controlling taste and texture. I could even sense his respect for food in every bite, and this deep understanding gives him limitless power of over his dishes.\\n\\nWe were lucky enough to get a tour of the kitchen as well, which was a lovey surprise. There, we observed the gears and cogs spinning in flawless motion. There must have been forty members of staff all working in utter concentration to please their guests. In the kitchen, the pastry chef demonstrated a fascinating preparation of a maple popsicle to us; she took a stick, dipped it in a pot of boiling maple syrup, and proceeded to roll it on a patch of apple juice ice. The resulting taste was a refreshing, sweet morsel.\\n\\nThis restaurant is truly a thing of wonders, and I\\'m so glad I was fortunate enough to experience it. If you are able to spend the money, it is more than worth it.\\n',\n",
       " \"I honestly can't write an in-depth description of each and every dish that we received.  I can say that the only reason this does have three stars is because of the service provided.  For such an expensive meal, each dish was good, not great.  I just feel like creativity fell dead here.  There were three interesting platings out of a series.  We were served chicken, fish, cheesecake with caviar.  Listen, don't get me wrong, it was GOOD.  Was it worth the money?  Was I awed as I was expected to be?  That's a hard no.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Incredible. The food was amazing. Honestly though, the first impression was not the greatest, but it got better and better. We had 11 courses of the best dishes over the past 11 years of the restaurant. One of them was a truffle and chicken breast which was the most tender chicken breast I've ever had so far (amazing textural combination with the crisp of the truffles). The turbot was also very well prepared. There was also a carrot tar tar that was surprisingly delicious and not very carrot-y at all. The deserts were also amazing especially the Milk and Honey. Perfectly light and rich at the same time. \\nMy only complaint was the slowness of the pace. Don't get me wrong, the service was extremely attentive and nice but for 11 courses, we sat there for 3.5 hours. And if I were to be nit-picky, the first two or three courses was too savory and over seasoned for me, namely the clams. But again, the food got exponentially creative, surprising and delicious.\\n\",\n",

My favorite dish was the novel egg Benedict, where the toasted English muffin and the caviar topped egg-yolk was separated. For main dish you got to choose from three options. I ordered duck breast and my friend ordered ox tail. Honestly the duck breast wasn\\'t tender enough to impress, and it was just ok. My friend quite enjoyed the ox tail though. For the dessert part we did not share the famous baked Alaska cuz I tried it elsewhere and did not really like the strong alcohol taste. The whole meal finished with a chocolate tasting game, \"Name that Milk\", where you got match four different milk used in the chocolates to the correct animals. Afterwards they offer home-made granola to take home. Would love to come here again for some special occasions.\\n',\n",

The restaurant was fairly empty when we showed up but filled up quickly in the next hour. Some of the dishes looked mediocre presentation wise but the flavors were definitely present. Out of the 20+ courses, my favorites were the eggs benedict and the foie gras. The egg benedict looked plastic and unappetizing when it was first presented so I was completely blown away by the taste. \\n\\nThe wait staff is extremely attentive; each time I took a sip of water or wine, someone would be back to refill it. If you had to use the bathroom, someone would always be there to walk you over. On one of the many trips I took the bathroom during this 4 hour dinner, I jokingly told a waiter I had to leave work early for the reservation and my manager wanted proof that I was indeed dining at EMP.

It was extremely thoughtful and witty! \\n\\nMy boyfriend had mentioned we were taking our first trip together to Hawaii the following week so after we were done with dinner and paid our bill, it was a complete surprise when they invited us to the kitchen for a tour. It is amazing how the kitchen of a restaurant serving 20+ courses is so clean and well organized. We were given an overview of how the kitchen is run, a tasting of apple snow and then they gifted us with lei's!

       " \"We had a lovely time. Staff was beyond friendly (although we did feel no one was over 23-27 years old working there, and wondered why), service was pretty attentive, sleek decor, and an overall lovely evening (still a very nice memorable celebration).  \\nBut I do not put this restaurant at the #1 in the world slot. And don't get how they have 3 Michelin stars. \\nOne thing that I hated was that it felt like a culinary school at all times with the kitchen making almost the exact same thing for every single table. You had a couple of options to choose from on the fixed menu told to you verbally, but it still felt like a school to me (us). \\nWhen we went to Brooklyn Fare ages ago for their then 24 course tasting with all 18 guests, it felt like a private dinner party where they thoughtfully created colorful, visual dishes and tastebud masterpieces. But here to be in a large restaurant with everyone basically having the same thing here, it lost something with it and it felt redundant like a school. \\nThe food was good, but I (we) didn't feel it surprised or blew us away. We didn't sense real creativity to it to warrant the level they claim to be. Mind you, we hate foams and too creative over the top annoying dishes, but we felt it lacked elegant upscale creative culinary expertise. \\nWe wished for mind blowing wow factors as each course came out, but never got it. Again, it was very nice, but just didn't blow us away. We've had very simple that's blown us away, and we never saw that during this meal either. \\nLe Bernardin is definitely still our favorite, and we are happy we dined here again since the reno, but I don't think we'd come back.\\nWe were very happy to have the kitchen tour, but we watched them escort in almost every table. Again, felt like a school.\\n\",\n",
       " \"A second visit on a beautiful spring day revealed a comfortable temperature inside.  I guess that this is a spot worth visiting when it's not really, really cold outside, because the inside temperature seems to match.\\n\",\n",
       " \"It's been almost two hours, and without a doubt, I can tell you the bread at 11 Madison is among the best in the world. Is the food worth the wait? Who can say, may never know. 3 stars. Good bread. No food.\\n\",\n",
       " 'What a disappointment. Seeing so many great reviews, maybe we just had really bad luck and hit them on an especially off night, but based on our most recent experience about a week ago, definitely do not understand the hype or the ratings and it really makes us question the value of Michelin stars. We have dined here several times in the past (prior to the recent renovation) and always had a wonderful experience. It used to be fun, the food was great and you never felt the time pass as you enjoyed a great meal with great service. This latest meal was almost torturous. We are used to \"fine dining\" and understand long meals, but whether it be here in the past or other restaurants along the lines of Jean Georges or Daniel (as a couple of examples) they have always been seamless experiences where you never feel like you are being left waiting or, worse, ignored. That was the case during our most recent evening at EMP. There was no interaction with the staff beyond the bare minimum obligatory exchanges. Long stretches of time would pass between courses when no one would even look our way much less come by our table. When we finally got someone\\'s attention and commented on the long wait for the next course, she sheepishly acknowledged that they had just changed menus and the kitchen was a little off. Even getting a glass of wine took forever. From the time it was ordered to when someone else put a glass on the table to when someone else brought the bottle to a serving station near us to when someone else finally poured it took about a half hour. The staff while very polite and efficient, seemed almost robotic and there appeared to be no \"adult\" in charge. You would think that after our comment about waiting so long, someone in a managerial position might stop by to apologize or at least acknowledge. It was just two of us (a married couple), and while we like each other well enough it was ridiculous how long we were left just idly sitting around waiting for food and drink. The meal took almost four hours! As for the food, it was fine. But I would not put it in the exceptional category that warrants the price paid or in comparison to other restaurants in this range and I would not be able to honestly tell anyone that it is worth the high price or giving up an evening for.\\n',\n",
       " \"So...I went to Atera before this. And I absolutely loved it. Complete with a personalized warm experience and food that was the epitome of a explosion of flavors on my palette. My assumption when our concierge set our reservation here was that a three Michelin star was leaps better than a two Michelin star restaurant. But dear god was I mistaken. \\n\\nA) the ambience here is terrible. There's nothing warm about this place except the dim lighting. I could see someone in the 60s, on a business meeting loving it here. But I'd never come on a date here. \\n\\nB) the distance between the kitchen and table were obviously great enough that the food wasn't warm or the plates feeling freshly plated.  Our venison was cold. The duck was seasoned but hard. The flavor of the duck tasted like I was eating at a Chinese restaurant in China town. The baccarat hotel's duck is leaps better and it's just a lobby. \\n\\nC) I get truffle is a delicacy in america. But that doesn't mean add a pound of truffle to everything you plate. I couldn't even taste the risotto because I was busy getting through the truffle. Why not just call it truffle with a dash of risotto. \\n\\nD) the caviar dish was delicious. Although it hasn't made up for the terrible other food. \\n\\nE) service, of course people were nice and enthusiastic. But....if I'm paying this amount I expect a level of service that is up to par. Mixing up our plates...of just three people is inexcusable. Bringing the wrong dish is also inexcusable. \\n\\nF) I am genuinely confused why this place is so famous and also the price point. No part beyond throwing in random truffle and caviar made it worth it. I also understand that people are often forced to think something is good because of name or reputation and especially a price point. But this does not deserve any of it. \\n\\nG) go to Atera if you'd like a gastronomic experience that lives up to your expectations.\\n\",\n",
       " \"So this restaurant is definitely up there in my top restaurants, but I would by no means call it #1. \\n-The first bite was a cross between a miniature black and white cookie and a ritz cracker cheese sandwich- nothing special to be honest.\\n-The scallop course next with live diver scallop and sea urchin was wonderful- so fresh and light with the uni not overpowering the dish at all. And it worked so well with the sparkling pinot from Burgundy. The bread and broth with scallop infused butter on the side was another meh for me.\\n-The sparkling pinot also worked well with the next dish- the play on eggs benedict with sturgeon caviar. A solid dish highlighted by the smoked ham with the caviar for me- they also provided miniature buns so you could create an egg mcmuffin sandwich of your own- very fun.\\n-Then they invited me back to the kitchen- very similar to the French Laundry and such a nice touch. There they prepared another bite in front of me- chimney bread with black truffles done in a relish, cream, and a garnish. Again, a great touch, but it made me uncomfortable. When I eat something wonderful I like to eat slowly, chew thoughtfully and breathe a little, close my eyes, it's all very personal. And here I am standing at the station with people all around me and the server waiting to escort me back to my table, and honestly I couldn't really enjoy the dish. \\n-Back at my table the next course was a definite wow for me- hudson valley foie gras with ginger, maple, and pickled apple paired with an amazing Cadillac (similar to a sauternes). I don't think I've ever taken as long to eat anything in my life, just couldn't bare to end it. The foie gras was perfect and the balance of the crisp pickled apple and the sweetness of the maple along with the Cadillac was just......I will be dreaming about this dish for quite awhile.\\n-The butter-poached lobster was next and honestly the whole dish fell flat for me. I couldn't get past how chewy the lobster was for one, and the butternut squash and chestnut and kale just didn't add any warmth to me- they really didn't add much at all, though the sauce that was plated with it was delicious. Also, I'm not a big fan of Chablis to begin with and it was too bright and metallic for the dish I thought.\\n-The mushroom tart was a table-side presentation and beautifully done- not to mention all the black truffle they shave over the crisp top. Over the top? Perhaps, but I loved it as someone who will never tire of all the truffle! In general though, I love mushrooms and this very pure mushroom dish was another highlight for me. I was excited about the Cabernet Franc from the Loire region as well (also as someone who loves Virginia/Maryland Cab Franc). It was definitely WAY more tannic than I was expecting and not something I could drink alone, but it did pair wonderfully with mushrooms and really brought out the funk in a good way.\\n-The duck dish was...disappointing, but not because of the flavors. I love dry-aging and the peppercorn and lavender crust was mindblowingly good. But. When the dish came out the first time, the duck was a bit well-done for my liking and after I had talked to my server about the lobster, they told me to please let them know if I wanted anything done differently, and they were very sweet about it. So I had them take it back and the duck that came back out was seared on top but raw the rest of the way- which was perfect for the thinner end of the cut. But once I got up to the thickest part, I honestly had to cut away some of the uncooked part because it was just too raw for me and I felt really bad having them take it back a second time. It was honestly a little frustrating to know just how amazing this dish would have been if the duck was cooked properly throughout- maybe not have such a variation of thickness within the cut to keep from the inconsistent cooking? Overlooking that, the potato and the leek dumplings were good and the 2005 Nebbiolo from Piedmont was perfect with this dish. I've never had a more divine-smelling wine too, just smelling the beautiful mix of earthy cherry and floral (lavender?) easily passed the time while I was waiting for the duck .\\n-It was fun to get a completely different preparation of a Nebbiolo from 2016 to compare with the last glass for the cheese course. The alpine cheese with celery root was wonderful and worked so well with this sweeter, more acidic Nebbiolo. The winter greens tossed in a black truffle dressing were a throw away for sure though and added nothing to the dish.\\n-Another oh wow was the pumpkin cake with bruleed butternut squash, butternut squash and yuzu ice cream with sarsaparilla. Such an amazing blend of gentle sweetness, salty and savory and then the acid of the yuzu just cuts it so well. The sweet Ramandolo complimented every bite, especially since the dessert itself was not very sweet to begin with. Another really slow eat as I hated to finish the dish.\\nAND Yelp apparently has a character limit\\n\",\n",
       " 'I had the Thanksgiving Experience during lunch on 11/24/16 instead of the Fall Tasting Menu.  It was a four-course meal with options for each course.  Our waiters were very attentive and receptive to any immediate needs.  We were even given a tour of the kitchen upon our request.  There was a cordial yet cultivated atmosphere that made our dining experience casually comfortable yet refined.\\n\\nFor my appetizer, I opted for foie gras on a brioche toast.  The duck liver had a very smooth consistency that was complemented well by the warm toast.  The black truffle pasta had strong fragrant nodes with each bite, albeit for an additional $99.  I had lobster for my main course, which was refreshing with flavorful hints of parsnip. My friend had a dry-aged cut of steak.  The sides were also phenomenal (the mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were among my favorite).  \\n\\nThe food was enticing and I plan to be back for the tasting menu.  A well recommended experience and very deserving of its Michelin rating.\\n',\n",
       " 'Not much else to add beyond the glowing reviews already written here. I appreciate the tone of the presentation. There is a wink to a couple of the courses that help breathe fresh air to the experience.\\n',\n",
       " 'Well, what can I say... Michelin Guide is very misguided in their 3 star rating for this mess of what some call \"the worlds best restaurant\".   We\\'ve been to many fine dining places in the city, including Daniels, Jean Georges, Per Se, and Masa to name a few, so it was good feel the caliber of this place in comparison to their competitors.\\n\\nWe had a reservation for 2 for dinner and arrived about 20 minutes early.  Upon entering, we were quickly approach by an uncomfortably high strung woman who\\'s energy seemed a bit too invasive for a high class restaurant.\\n\\nSince we came a bit early, we were guided to a waiting area with 2 chairs right in the unsightly intersection of the hallway, bathrooms, coat check and second floor stairway, basically the busiest cross section of the place with groups of people constantly lining up with their rears toward you as they wait for their coats, bathroom, etc.  Totally uncomfortable, noisy, and hectic place to sit customers for the waiting area.  Once they finally realized the chaos we were placed in, someone came, apologized and took us to our table.  At this point, we were tense, uncomfortable and definitely not in a fine dining mood.\\n\\nAs we were seated, we were given a wine list that is as thick as an encyclopedia, and a pleasant woman came to discuss the best wines for our taste, this went pretty well.\\n\\nWhile waiting for our wine, a careless waiter serving the table next to us knocked over a patrons\\' cell phone on the floor.\\n\\nWhen our waiter came, he told us the menu items and we had to choose right there what we wanted (we were never given a menu to look at), but had to choose on the spot while he stood there and mentioned their items.  This made everything seem rushed and pressured.  To add further, as soon as the waiter took our order, he tells us he will take our desert order later, creating further feelings of being rushed somewhere.\\n\\nAt this point, we\\'re happy to see our wine being poured so we can finally take a little breather from all this mess.   \\n\\nI won\\'t get into minute detail, but the presentation of dishes was very lackluster (dark, grey, bland colors, no pizzaz), the flavors were overpowering each other  (e.g. truffle dish was overpowered by the hollandaise sauce it was mixed with, the caviar in another dish was overpowered by the smoked/salty fish cream).  By the way, these dishes were served in Tin Cans!, similar to the ones supermarket sardines would be placed in.  This is supposed to give a sense of freshness eh?   \\n\\nAs I was eating the warm bread bun with butter over a small plate, one busgirl just pushes my plate aside from under me, mid-bite, and puts another dish in front of me.  I almost choked.\\n\\nAnother absurd dish I was served was essentially a small piece of toasted rye bread with bitter tasting lettuce on top and some salad dressing type sauce.  At this point I\\'m realizing that the joke\\'s on us.  You\\'re kidding me with lettuce on toast right? \\n\\nIt gets better... I am then served some kind of pancake looking dish that is elegantly called \"Beluga Lentils\", it\\'s just beans compressed together with potatoes and garlic.  \\n\\nThe main course, which was duck, was cooked OK, but the meat was chewy and bland.\\n\\nThe only half decent dish was the mushroom tart with crimini and truffle mushrooms.\\n\\nWe must have had 5 or 6 different busboys/girls come to our table throughout the night, most were trying to please, but unfortunately, this created a sense of constant distraction with so many different people coming and talking to you.  When the crumbs were being wiped from our table, some were spilled on me and hit my hand and pants.\\n\\nFor desert, I had a pear-cranberry donut, that\\'s right a freakin donut.  Although not bad tasting for a diner perhaps, this is not acceptable for such a restaurant.   Although we were not finished with desserts, our main waiter took it from our table without asking if we were finished, making us feel like he wanted us to leave quicker as this was already 12:20am.\\n\\nThe decor inside is bland, boring, colorless, no flowers or any soul...  staff is also dressed in gray.  I thought these guys just renovated?   \\n\\nAnyway, we were completely blown away by the failures on all levels in this restaurant and totally didn\\'t expect this from a 3 star michelin restaurant.  After doing some research on Michelin, we realized it\\'s all a farce, see this Vanity Fair Review of Michelin\\'s approach, it put everything into perspective for us:\\n\\nhttps://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/11/whats-wrong-with-the-michelin-guide\\n\\n\\nProbably this place would have more 1 star reviews if people didn\\'t mind re-living their bad experiences and writing them here, but most probably avoid doing.\\n',\n",

       " 'My husband and I made reservations in the bar area, which allows you to do a five course dinner.  We just came from a wedding and didn\\'t plan on being hungry enough for 11 courses.  We started with cocktails and then proceeded with wine pairings.  The pairing for $85pp was worth it!  The craft cocktails were the some of the best we\\'ve had and worth trying.\\n\\nThe menu walked us through a history of dishes at the restaurant.  Some, like the first course served in a martini glass, had a fun explanation, while others were just accompanied by the year.  It would be interesting to know what the inspiration behind the dish was rather than only a year for those dishes that had little description.\\n\\nWhat was most memorable included the prawn salad, paired with a sake, which was an unusual pairing but a perfectly balanced and surprisingly wonderful combination.  The duck breast was perfectly crisp on the outside and well flavored.  My husband had foie gras and the suckling pig, both of which were his favorite was well.  While we didn\\'t leave hungry, we did feel the portions could be slightly larger, even after just coming from a wedding.  We ended up helping ourselves to an extra dinner roll, baked with cheese, warm, and delicious, but usually we don\\'t feel the need to fill up on bread unless necessary.  Other tasting menus we\\'ve tried came with extra \"snacks\" or surprise courses in between, and that was not done here.  They did give you the extra dessert treats at the end.\\n\\nThe wine pairings were so expertly paired, though, that I could hardly complain.  They do give you a generous pour and bring the bottle table side for you to inspect, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nI do think it would have been nice to have been offered a kitchen tour, even if only eating in the bar area.  However, from a service standpoint, we were never made to feel second class, which I was worried about and unable to find reviews on.  We did leave with the gift bags of granola, which is delicious.  I have to stop myself from eating it out of the jar.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant, though you should not reserve bar seating if you have a larger appetite.\\n',\n",

It has fallen short in my eye due to lack of professionalism/edict. I understand the how the reservation system works, I also understand how the wait list works. But to not have the decency to contact your guests weather on wait list or not, to inform them prior to their reservation that they unfortunately would not be able to accommodate you, is tacky and tasteless. We all know that you and your reservation staff are very well informed ahead of time and could easily inform the guests who have been waiting patiently, that they unfortunately will not be accommodating them tastefully. Instead you choose to leave them hanging out to dry like as if they do not matter to you in the slightest. It is extremely gross in nature and this is the place that was chosen to receive such high ratings? But yet they lack in reservation edict/professionalism! I truly hope that your management team reads and learns from this. You do not deserve your stars without being well rounded from front to back and top to bottom. Revise your edict and pick up your slack, because it makes you look extremely tacky and tasteless. Very sad day to be honest.\\n',\n",

Both were lovely and flavorful. \\n\\nWe had the \"bar menu\". This was a delicious 5 course experience of caviar, lamb, duck, lobster and other fresh seasonal vegetables. To finish we enjoyed dessert and chocolate pretzels. Every plate was absolute perfection. Beyond perfection! Clean to taste, spices and herbs were all delicately placed on the dishes, sauces were perfect- not heavy or salty. In fact, the sauces added just the right amount of \"kick\" to each plate.

       " 'The Story: I would like to announce that one of my bucket list restaurants is now off my list. I\\'ve been dreaming about coming here for quite a while now so when my cousin asked if anyone is interested to go with her, my name was one of the very first on the list! \\n\\nFood: Usually I will list what I liked and what I didn\\'t like but I feel like this place deserved a list. Luckily they provided me with a menu so I know what they served me. (I know they try to explain each dish but I\\'m usually too busy oogling the plate lol)\\n\\nI had a total of 16 amazing bites of culinary heaven..\\n\\n1. Chedder: Savory Black & White Cookie with Apple. - I wanted this cookie to be sweet but enjoyed it nevertheless. \\n\\n2. Tuna: Marinated with Cucumber - Presentation for this is lovely. It tasted like I was eating a salad. \\n\\n3. Eggplant: Slow-cooked with Shelling Beans and Mint - It tasted to me like a pickled plum and I was at first taken aback because I was expecting eggplant.\\n\\n4. Squid: Poached with Peppers and Artichoke - This plate was also beautiful and you can really taste how the squid and peppers mix together.\\n\\n5. Tomato: Salad with Basil and Red Onion - Presentation was great. I expected a slice of tomato but it tasted like a hearty tomato soup instead.\\n\\n6. Caviar: Benedict with Egg, Corn and Ham - This is the dish that started to get me excited. The first 5 dish I\\'ve already tasted the flavor profile elsewhere. They served this with mini english muffins and the soft boiled quail egg in the middle is amazing. Gooey Goodness!\\n\\n7. Foie Gras: Seared with Thyme - This is actually my first time trying Foie Gras. It\\'s a little heavy for my taste and the portion they gave me was way too much. The flavor profile with the pickled apricot was amazing though. My brother also joked that 11 Madison Park ruined my Foie Gras experience because it\\'s probably the best in the world.\\n\\n8. Bread: Served with Cow\\'s Milk Butter & Duck Fat Butter - I had one right away because I was still hungry at this point. I didn\\'t eat breakfast because I was expecting 16 courses. I liked the regular butter over the duck fat. \\n\\n9. Lobster: Boile with clams, shrimp and beans -   There wasn\\'t much in this dish but everything was cooked perfectly. I\\'m not a lobster girl but their bite of lobster made me second guess myself.\\n\\n10. Sunflower: Braised with Green Tomato and Sunflower Sprouts - I find this dish interesting. However, I didn\\'t really like the flavor profile for this dish. Very pretty though.\\n\\n11. Duck: Roasted with Lavender, Honey, Apricots, and Fennel - I LOOOVED this dish. I was excited when they brought out the display duck to tell us Duck is going to be our next course. The skin was crispy and the meat was tender. I think I definitely spend a lot longer savoring this dish. \\n\\n12. Farmer\\'s Cheese: Sundae with Honey, Cherry, Sorrel and Oats - I\\'m not a big cheese eater. The cheese by itself is extremely salty but paired with the flavors on the lazy susan...HEAVEN. \\n\\n13. Whey: Sorbet with Caramelized Milk and Yogurt - I\\'m a derp that ate just the whey and yogurt and complained to my cousins that its too \"tart\". Dug a little deeper and my opinion changed instantly. Wow! Love the balance of flavors.\\n\\n14. Berry: Cheesecake with White Currant Sorbet and Raspberry Vinegar - It\\'s like eating cake without the cake. Beautiful flavors balanced so well. \\n\\n15. Chocolate: Name That Milk - They presented us with 4 chocolate bars made with different animal milk (cow, buffalo, goat and lamb). I now know my palate works lol The goat and lamb chocolate isn\\'t that good...\\n\\n16. Chocolate 2.0: Pretzel with Sea Salt - This is by far the best chocolate pretzel I\\'ve ever had. It\\'s white chocolate dipped into regular chocolate and has hints of pretzel in it. AMAZING!\\n\\n17. Fruit Bar: with Abraham - After exiting the restaurant, we were instructed to go say \"hello\" to Abraham and he\\'ll give us a gift. We got a iced fruit bar. Yum!\\n                       \\n\\nPrice: $225 per person with no wine paring. A splurge but definitely worth it. \\n\\nDecor:  Really nice high ceilings and natural lighting from huge glass windows. Sunflowers everywhere. Beautiful place. \\n\\nService: As expected, the service was amazing! My glass of water never hit under 50% mark, all the plates were placed in-front of us at the same time. They kept our table clean even though breadcrumbs where flying all over the place. I was pretty sure we each had our own waiter/waitress, but I cannot confirm that 100%.\\n\\nParking & Finding the Place: Located at 11 Madison Avenue in New York City. My cousins thought I was joking when I said that was the address haha. It\\'s right across from the Madison Park and you can get here either by cab, car service or the subway (6).  .\\n\\nAdditional Thoughts: Truly a once in a life time dream come true.

Dinner was 3hrs 15mins long after drinking as much apple brandy as we could. We sat in a corner seat on the second tier facing the chalk board painting. We did't get the wine paring as we just wanted a Syrah to enjoy. Had some coffee at the end and all was good. One thing I forgot to look at, or maybe I didn't notice it for a reason, was the old kitchen step. Maybe next time.... good times.\\n\",\n",

Everything was carefully presented and thoughtful.  \\n\\nThe bread was super flaky and the butter...  Can I just live on that butter?  One course involved a picnic basket and I just died at how cute it was.  Another course involved a mini grill.  Literally, a mini grill appeared at the table.  I loved how involved we got into our meals.  One course involved corn multiple ways and it was absolutely fabulous.  \\n\\nI don't really like foie gras but damn, that was beautiful.  Everything was amazing and we even had a celebrity sighting!  Great service and presentation.  A memorable experience!\\n\",\n",

The celery root that is basted in the pig's bladder is quite the table side show, but I do have to admit I wasn't wowed by the dish. The venison on the other hand was outstanding! \\n\\nDepending on your preference on wine I would recommend the wine pairings. One of the pairings was a little two sweet for my liking but otherwise it was still worth the whole experience.\\n\\nI only gave it three stars because the ambiance was almost too stuffy and the food wasn't quite as Top notch as similar restaurants like Del Posto.

I sat at the bar, so maybe the experience at the bar pales in comparison to the real dining room experience.  The croissant-like roll was delicious, but my dishes were just okay.

The famous duck which I loved on the initial visit tasted far too salty and dry. Many of the dishes tasted too one dimensional.\\n',\n",

The ability to participate in the dining experience, such as customizing and mixing your own carrot tartare, definitely set it apart from the rest. The apple brandy was unlimited and at the end of the meal, everyone got to take home a mason jar of delicious granola.

The service was great though and have to say, they shake up some pretty yummy cocktails. The location and ambiance is also top notch making this place a solid three stars for me.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I've been to a lot of Michelin star Restaurants but this is truly one of my favorites thus so far.  The service is alone one of the reasons why this Resturant is so special. There is a reason why a place like this is Michelin rated and why each person for dinner is about 200-250. That price is without wine too. For only 15 people and the dinner being 5369.72 is not a cheap dinner. I felt that the food delivery was way to slow for my tasting. I was tired and bored waiting for my food..\\n\",\n",
       " \"Eleven Madison Park comes off like a precocious child: clever, creative, but not really interested in things that take time, skill, and training. \\n\\nOur meal included items that were imaginative and dramatic - like caviar served in a picnic basket and fruit grilled at our table.  \\n\\nBut there was nothing we couldn't find at less storied restaurants.  For example, the seafood boil we tried can be had at any Cajun joint.  There was nothing interesting about it other than its presence at a Michelin starred restaurant.  The overdone steak, which would be disappointing at Sizzler, featured some rather blah side dishes of mash potatoes.  Dishes were either pleasantly mediocre, or in the case of the steak, bitterly disappointing (and dryly chewy).\\n\\nIf only the food was as good as the staff, who  worked to anticipate our needs and seemed sincerely concerned that we didn't enjoy our meal.  \\n\\nI think the only way I could be lured back is if Eleven Madison Park promised a meal that displayed real culinary skill than showmanship.\\n\",\n",
       " 'So this is the fourth 3 Michelin Star restaurant we\\'ve tried in the past two years for dinner. I\\'m counting \"Daniel\" since it was a 3-Star prior to this year\\'s demotion. Have to say, Eleven Madison Park is not on top of the list in comparison to Per Se, Jean-Georges or Daniel.\\n\\nWe were a party of five, seated at probably the best table in the restaurant in terms of its location within the place. First thing I noticed; very casual dress code. I inquired, there wasn\\'t one. Probably wouldn\\'t have dined there had I known I was going to be sitting across eye-view of people in their short-sleeved bowling shirts. The place was at a fantastic physical location, however, with views of Madison Square Park and wide windows. Even the entrance felt majestic.  But inside it didn\\'t feel exclusive. People spoke and laughed loudly.  Bar was well in view and I found that to be quite uncomfortable as well.  I liked the decor, but then again it was catered to this \"casual\" setting which I didn\\'t expect.\\n\\nEVERY person from the moment you entered the restaurant to the moment we left was friendly, knowledgeable and willing to answer and assist with anything we needed.  So don\\'t blame the staff; they did what they were asked to deliver.\\n\\nWe were introduced by Steven with the crux of our evening. He was a friendly gent and expertly knew the answers to any of our questions. Started with a small, ribboned box and five cookies inside, then a stacked tray of what looked to me like steamed dumpling trays, which turned out to be starters intended to wet our palates.\\n\\nAll dishes to follow were unique. I especially love the detail flowers in some of the dishes which not only added to the presentation but mostly to the flavor. Lavender duck, unfortunately, paled in comparison to the duck at Per Se.  Baked Alaska at the end of the meal, what happened to the rest of it?!\\n\\nI loved the potatoes, whether creamed, au gratin, or simply scooped and shaped, they were very flavorful.  I would say the dish with caviar and kernels of corn was my favorite dish.\\n\\nI want to mention the dish with the asparagus steamed inside the pig\\'s bladder.  Not the most pleasant aroma while this was happening in front of us since there is nothing like hot animal bladder air being blown my way to conjure up my appetite.  Asparagus, however, was probably the most tender and flavorful asparagus I have ever had.\\n\\nWe were given a chocolate tasting \"game\" before desert. This game provided four types of chocolate, and we had to match the milk used for each, whether it was from a cow, a bison, a lamb or a goat.  I\\'m very proud to say that I was the only one at my table with all four correctly matched answers.  But what was my prize?  There wasn\\'t.\\n\\nEnd of the evening, we were all given a glass container filled with \"trail mix\" and the same tin container the caviar came in, with our menu inside.  The menu was not customized so we each had the entire menu and not what we selected as souvenir. Yes, the date was on there, but just like the dress code, I was left a bit uneasy.\\n\\nGratuity not accepted.  OK, that sure didn\\'t sat well with me.  Wanted to show my appreciation to the staff but the opportunity was not available.\\n\\nOne thing that really turned me off was a select few were given the tour of the kitchen; we weren\\'t.  What was the selection process?  It appeared random.  Well, we were not given a tour, and that pretty much cinched the 3-star rating here for me.\\n\\nIf you\\'d ordered a bottle of wine prior to some particular date which I stopped paying attention to, you\\'d get this contraption where they literally cut off a section of the bottle neck since the cork is too dried up to be pulled.  Again, they\\'ll wheel out a table where they need to showcase their advance pyro technique to literally melt the neck off the wine bottle.  Pig\\'s bladder, Baked Alaska, and this wine opening thing, at time it seems this was more of a circus act than fine dining.\\n\\nListen, I am very particular; I sometimes pay more attention to the little things and not the main elements.  Well, I strongly believe the little things are at times more memorable than the obvious; that\\'s just me.  I don\\'t think I would return to Eleven Madison Park, simply because if someone asks me which 3 Michelin Star restaurants in NYC I would I recommend, the answer would be \"I\\'ve only been to four, and so far my favorite is Per Se.\"\\n\\nWe\\'re looking to try Le Bernardin and Masa later this year and that will conclude our list of the current 3 Michelin Star restaurants in NYC.  No, I didn\\'t forget Chef\\'s Table; it\\'s in Brooklyn, not my thing (no offense to Brooklyn).  Will gladly await its Manhattan opening in 2017.\\n',\n",

With that said, EMP still earns every star and award they've gotten.  I had an outstanding experience.\\n\\nNearly everything was outstanding, but for me two things stood out.  First, the smaller dishes.  the main courses of lobster, duck and beef were very tasty, but they weren't the greatest part of the meal.  The best items were typically the underappreciated fruits, vegetables and small bites that would get scant attention at other restaurants.  Grilled pieces of plum and melon were outstanding, seared corn paired with creamed corn was strange and lovely at the same time, savory and salty one-bite cookies.  The small bites and vegetables made the meal for me.  The only item on the menu I didn't enjoy 100% was the duck - slightly tough.\\n\\nThe second thing that stood out was the service.  Absolutely impeccable and probably the most attentive service I've ever gotten at a restaurant.  The presentations of food are unique and very creative, and are executed flawlessly by the staff.

To clarify, we are recent transplants in NYC so we try the tick down the list, but we have done visits mostly internationally. Let me leave the guessing out - if Pete Wells of the New York Times was visiting Eleven Madison tonight (Nov. 23rd), his review would have likely sent a shock-wave throughout the world of fine dining.  \\nI\\'ll leave the food out, for the most part, as one can say it was Thanksgiving so the chef clearly just phoned it in. No creativity whatsoever, bland taste and very little flavor. Instead, i\\'ll focus on the service, but circle back to the food later. \\nThe service was awful. I wish there was another way to put it but from start to finish, it was just not good. I don\\'t want to bore anyone with play-by-play so here are the highlights: cocktail glass and wine glass empty without being asked to refill or alternative. Server couldn\\'t answer questions about the gluten free bread my wife was having. Very little check in throughout the meal, rushed service and very impersonal and lastly it took more than 5 minutes to find our coats as we were leaving. \\nI must address the food after all. No Amuse-bouche, absolutely no accommodation to gluten free - my wife\\'s dessert was a joke of 12 berries put together, super small portions, only 3 courses, no cheese or after dinner cocktail offering and then again very bland food. Overall, felt very rushed and that no one from the staff really wanted to be there. For the $300/pp price tag, it was a complete rip off. \\nI don\\'t recommend it at all, the space itself doesn\\'t feel intimate like Per Se or Masa, the lighting is bad and again, just not worth the price.

Ever. There really is no question about it.\\n- The foie gras and their interpretation of eggs benedict stood out to me as well.\\n- Good variety of bread, which was fresh and warm as well. The butter was silky smooth and perfectly rich.\\n- The waiter was very attentive to my requests, specifically for my food to be lightly salted since I found the earlier dishes a bit heavy. \\n\\nCons:\\n- I was incredibly disappointed by one of the courses, the \"whey sorbet\". It honestly tasted so disgusting and I could barely choke down half of it. My waiter noticed and didn\\'t offer a replacement dish or anything. \\n- Tiny, tiny portions. I know fine dining focuses on quality over quantity, but compared to other 3 star restaurants, it still paled in comparison. While 11 courses sounds like a lot, they count the amuse bouche and palette cleansers as well. \\n\\nTakeaway:\\nDefinitely, definitely recommend going for their a la carte menu, which includes the duck!

I think for me, the finishing touches stood out the most, the slightly dented plates for the picnic in central park, and the little grill that comes to the table to grill the peaches for dessert. The staff were very accommodating with tastes and palates, we had 2 vegetarians and a pescetarian in the party, with very different approaches to cocktails and menu items. \\n\\nOverall, a great experience, I would definitely recommend doing the tasting menu here.\\n',\n",

That was me.\\n \\nMy review is probably harsh and nitpicky but I can list other restaurants that have outdone EMP in different areas.\\n \\n4 star service - wait staffs were attentive but they fell short personalization and synchronization.\\nA)    Personalization - before arriving, EMP contacts you to see if it\\'s a special occasion, if you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions.  We went there for our anniversary and not that I am looking for complimentary toast or dessert but no one mentioned or congratulated us on our anniversary.  That was a minor miss.  The bigger misses were in the beginning.  The wait staff asked again if we had any food allergies or food aversion.  We said no.  But the survey was already taken the day before so it would be nice for the staff to reconfirm our answer rather than re-asking the same question we already answered. \\n\\nB)    Synchronization - this is an observation on the party of 6 table in front of us where plates were not served in sync.  It was a table of 3 ladies and 3 gentlemen with 3 wait staff serving.  The plates came out the same time but placing it on the table was off and at one point a gentleman was served first before the plate was served to the lady (Big Gasp right?!?).  This SUPER nitpicky but I always remember how well Del Posto executed their plate-serving synchronization when we went as a group of 5.\\n\\n3 star food/menu - there were no physical menus presented but the server spoke about the options.  I personally appreciate visually seeing what\\'s on the menu and the components in the dish so I can be more engaged with my dishes incase I have questions on the ingredients.  The food itself was good but it was nothing mind blowing except for the caviar dish for me.  That was amazing!  The food in general was good but not memorable.  It was bland and maybe it\\'s the menu served that day but it\\'s missing complexity.  That especially goes for the lobster dish which is essentially the tail plus some bisque which by the way my husband had a piece of shell on his dish. The presentation was lacking.  Same plates were used throughout the meal and nothing creative with plating.  Our wine pairing glasses had more character than the plates.  Per Se definitely takes the cake in everything but especially in presentation.  One negative note on the food is the duck.  I\\'m a huge duck fan and whenever that\\'s an option on the menu, that would be my go to.  I felt mine was overcooked and had to send it back for a more medium/pink center one.  The replacement one came and it was still over cooked to the point where it was super hard for me to cut with the smooth edge knife they served it with.  I felt a serrated knife would be a more proper utensil pairing but they did not have any in the restaurant.\\n \\n4 star cocktail drinks - drinks were good and good presentation but of course it doesn\\'t compare drinks at Flatiron Room, Raines Law Room, etc.\\n \\n3 star ambiance/décor - the space is big and open with very high ceilings with a modern look but it\\'s not warm, engaging or stimulating.

I have been to French Laundy, Daniel,  La Bernadine, Del Posto, Nomad, Gagan in Bangkok, etc. I experienced 11 Madison Park first many years ago and it stayed with me as an amazing experience. We had dinner April 8 and I've toyed with weather I should write this review.  My recent trip there was a huge disappointment at best. I bought this as an engagement gift for my fiancé. For the hype(best in the world?) and the price I was so excited to take him as he's never been. I talked it up so much. The new dining room is pretty and nice bar. The service was good nothing stellar. The food was...ok. Not bad but not mind blowing. Duck was a bit dry. The cheese dish was so rich and salty.  Honestly I can't even remember the other dishes and they should not be forgettable. This goes down as one of life's big disappointments. Was really expecting to be wowed. Would have preferred Del Posto or Nomad for much less. Feel like I should do a do over just to make sure it wasn't a one off but not for that price. Ruined my opinion forever:(.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve wanted to eat here for about four years and now finally I am able to afford it (and get a reservation). I imagined the food to be \"blow your mind\" flavor bombs and the service to better than any restaurant I\\'ve ever been to. I thought I would come out of that meal rating this 5 stars and wanting to come back, I think this place deserves a solid 4.\\n\\nIt was raining this past Sunday and my friend and I were wet and a bit out of breath from running into the building. Immediately I felt out of place, like they thought we were lost. But after we sat down, the food came quickly and it was a blast of flavor at every bite, starting with a savory black and white cookie (a twist on a NYC classic!).\\n\\nAfter we had a few small bites, the waiter rattled off menu choices: sunflower or tomato basil salad? lobster boil or fish? duck or steak? He spoke very fast and didn\\'t seem very patient to repeat himself. Maybe it\\'s just me, but I had trouble following along. There was also a man who refills water glasses and scrapes bread crumbs off the table. He was very cold towards us and I kept feeling like I was making a mess and causing him to do more work. On the other hand, there was this woman server who was extremely friendly and personable and redeemed the service aspect of this meal.\\n\\nThe food was great. The 140 day dry-aged ribeye and the tomato basil salad were the stars of the meal. The only critique I have of the meal was that it involved too much pickling that ended up too sour (pickled fish, pickled eggplant, etc.). The interaction I had with the food also made the meal enjoyable and was unlike any other experience I\\'ve had before at a restaurant. We had a course served from a picnic basket, a mini grill for grilling fruit at the table, and the infamous chocolate game at the end.\\n\\nAll this being said, it was my first 3 Michelin star experience. The only other Michelin restaurant I have been to is 1-starred Tom Aikens in London three years ago. That is the only basis I have to compare EMP to. While EMP has better food, I remember Tom Aikens having warm and friendly service. However, I look forward to trying more Michelin restaurants in the future!\\n',\n",

       " 'Fine dining at its absolute best. Courses are executed perfectly, presented in whimsical ways that make for a truly delightful meal. For example, the caviar course is presented as a picnic, complete with plates resembling their paper counterparts and a delicious tomato-champagne \"soda\" for you to unpack at the table. The use of seasonal ingredients was also enjoyable and very appropriate given the warm summer weather.\\n\\nService strikes the perfect balance of warmth and professionalism - our servers were friendly and engaging, without any hint of pretentiousness. The dining space is grand and lofty, with large sunflower arrangements and plenty of natural light that make for a warm, inviting atmosphere. \\n\\nAt $295 per person before drinks, EMP is hardly a bargain, but well worth it. The food is delicious as expected, but the dining experience as a whole is truly a delight, managing to be simultaneously refined yet fun. After having dined here, it is clear why EMP is truly deserving of all the praise it has garnered, including being ranked best restaurant in North America for 2016.\\n',\n",
       " 'I hate to say it, but my experience at EMP was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have had in a while. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was lovely, but the food was downright disappointing compared to what you would expect from a 3-star Michelin restaurant, and what some people claim is one of the best restaurants in the world. \\n\\nFood: There was an overall lack of innovation when it came to flavor and ingredients. Here\\'s the rundown...\\n- Black and White Savory Cookie with Apple and Cheddar: honestly just tasted strange\\n- Parsnip Pie: My favorite of the hors d\\'oeuvres\\n- Celery Root: Fine\\n- Rutabaga: Unusual flavor, not in a positive way\\n- Salsify: Fine\\n- Caviar: This was my absolute favorite dish of the meal. Was essentially mini eggs Benedict with caviar. That being said, the only really unique part of the dish was that it involved caviar. Otherwise, the hollandaise and other flavors were well executed, but hollandaise isn\\'t exactly the hardest thing to make.\\n- Scallop: The scallop was completely tasteless. The leeks were the flavor focal point of the dish, and they were delicious, but the fact that they overshadowed the scallops was odd.\\n- Lobster: Lovely presentation (they showed it to you in its pot at the table), but the flavor wasn\\'t anything special for a lobster\\n- Sweet Potato: My least liked dish. There was really nothing unique about this at all. It was literally a slice of sweet potato with a little sauce and minimal smokiness. If you have option to go with butternut squash, choose that instead. Flavor was way better. \\n- Duck: So disappointing. EMP is supposed to be famous for their dish, but ours came out cold and overcooked. \\n- Cato Corner Hooligan: Really delicious and came with a side salad with a great vinaigrette. That being said, it was basically a croquet, and also isn\\'t that hard to make. \\n- Apple Toffee Cake: Too tart. \\n- Baked Alaska: The cake was full of alcohol, making the cake hard to swallow. I get that that\\'s what baked Alaska is, but it wasn\\'t exactly pleasant to eat, nor did it really taste like a sweet dessert. The presentation though, was lovely.\\n- Chocolate pretzels and \"Name that Milk\" chocolates: very tasty\\n- Bottle of brandy: Nice touch\\n\\nWon\\'t be returning, at least for a while.\\n',\n",

This was the first tasting menu that my friend had ever tried and she really enjoyed the experience.  Everyone was very helpful and attentive.  I noticed that some reviewers had some problems, but we did not experience any problems.  \\nThe food was comparable to other Michelin star restaurants that I have visited and the overall experience was great.\\nMy only (minor) problem was that the presentation of some of the courses could have been better.  A mostly white course on a white plate does not bring out the best presentation.  In other restaurants, they either highlight with a sauce or use a plate of a contrasting color.\\n',\n",

Its  $295 a person + tax and drinks, but tips are included, so it clocks in at one of the most expensive meals in the city.\\n\\nOur main waiter was young Giovanni Ribsi look-alike and this guy did it all. He took the orders, he brought the food, he cooked food live table side, and he had a story for every dish.\\nThe rest of the staff was awesome, and like other reviewers have said, are definitely just ordinary dudes. None of that pretentious \"all french staff\" some places had.. (i\\'m looking at you Le Bernardin)\\n\\nIts the small things that really make this place excellent. For example they will always make sure your bottle of beer always has the label facing you while it sits on the table, and they will even put it on ice to keep it cold while you finish your glass.\\n\\nThe dishes were absolutely delicious, simple, with an amazing presentation all at the same time. Nothing pretentious like everything covered with truffles or a potato chip with something raw on top (yes EVERY restaurant is doing this stupid crap now with potato chips).\\n\\nI loved the fact that many of the dishes were interactive and either featured a small show table-side, or had to be put together - especially the mini English muffins with a side of quail egg omelette that you make into tiny sandwiches. Fun and delicious. \\n\\nFor a 2.5 hour meal, I was not bored at any point. There was always something going on.\\n\\nSome other great tidbits was the all-you-can eat fresh croissants with butter and sea salt, the 2nd slice of dessert (once we asked why they showed us an entire pie table side but gave us only a tiny slice), and for big drinkers, a complimentary BOTTLE of liquor at the end of your meal (usually whisky or brandy, no chasers though, so not easy to drink). \\n\\nI found it a bit funny they are still doing their \"guess that chocolate\" with the Mast brothers Brooklyn chocolate after their scandal about how they are selling melted Hershey\\'s at $10 a bar.\\n\\nAlso, the goody bags with chocolate birthday truffles and a jar of granola when you leave was an excellent touch.\\n\\nWould I come here again? yes definitely for a very special occasion. The only 2 or 3 star Michelin restaurant I can say that for\\n\\nBottom line however, even after trying almost every top Michelin restaurant in NYC, I can now safely say that none of these places are REALLY worth the $300+ price tags and the Michelin rating system is a total sham.\\n\\n==========\\nThat being said here\\'s my Ultra-High end tasting menu/Michelin Star grading sheet from Best to Worst:\\n\\n- Eleven Madison Park A\\n\\n- Brooklyn Fare C\\n\\n- Momofoku Ko D\\n\\n- Le Bernardin F\\n\\n- Semilla F\\n',\n",

       " 'It\\'s been 2 1/2 years since we\\'ve been to EMP, so this review comes a bit late (and in the midst of some substantial changes to the menu, from what I understand). But even years later, EMP remains my GOAT - my favorite restaurant and favorite meal of all time.\\n\\nEMP has plenty of company in New York when it comes to world-renowned restaurants that focus on service as much as they do food. If you like to count Michelin stars, Le Bernardin, Jean Georges, and Per Se all excel at this. But the reason I place EMP so squarely and unquestionably above the rest is how much of an experience the entire meal is, from before you walk in the door to when you walk out.\\n\\nThere is clearly a great deal of effort that goes into this experience, but it all seems so effortless when you see it in motion. You\\'re aware of the large staff they have on hand, but they\\'re never intrusive and never hover. At the same time, you are never ignored - I was taking much longer than normal on a course (my own fault) and was eventually asked if everything was okay with the dish - a nice reminder that they are paying careful attention.\\n\\nThe environment and feel at EMP is noticeably younger than at its counterparts in the city, and the age of our fellow diners reflected that (most people looked in their 20s/30s). It\\'s not a casual place by any means (the people using old fashioned irons on the tablecloths at empty tables will remind you of that), but the atmosphere is more friendly and doesn\\'t feel stuffy in the slightest. They really hit the sweet spot here in making sure you feel comfortable throughout the entire meal.\\n\\nAnd then there\\'s the food. EMP Is priced similarly to its competitors, and the meal took roughly the same amount of time (about 3 hours). But at 16 courses the meal just blows everything else out of the water. They could have easily done half of these courses with larger portions, and this meal would still stand up to the others. These are 16 well planned, well executed, creative dishes that at times have an element of fun to them - we were treated to a sort of \"ode to New York,\" starting with a savory black and white cookie and ending with a sweet one.\\n\\nI could go on and on about each of these dishes, but my opinion boils down to this - EMP belongs on every foodie\\'s bucket list. Not sure how the new format turned out, but I plan on finding out soon.\\n',\n",

       " \"I really can't say enough bad things about the food at Eleven Madison Park.  I took my Dad and his wife here for lunch and we all had a horrible meal.  \\n\\nI really don't care how many times you wish my Dad happy birthday or how often you refill my water or take me on a tour of the kitchen or give me a goody bag.  That's all schtick.  All I want is a good tasting meal, and we did not get that at Eleven Madison Park. \\n\\nWhat was very surprising was that I didn't like ANY of the courses until the duck arrived, which is sort of the main course of the meal.  Yes the duck was good but the prior 6 courses I would label as disgusting.  It got to the point where I needed to visit the bathroom to walk around and cool down because I couldn't believe that I could dislike everything being served.  I even told my family that I would pay the restaurant not to serve some of those courses. \\n\\nIt seems to me that they took foods that naturally would have tasted delicious, but instead added all these flavor combinations which ended up making delicious things disgusting.  One course had apple slices that were soaked in vinegar, so your brain thinks you're eating apple but it tasted so bad.  Another course, the lobster, which we all know is normally a delicious food, they prepare it in such a way that you would have to put tremendous effort to make lobster taste poorly and that's precisely what they did. \\n\\nHey look I'm probably the only person this has happened to at Eleven Madison Park, and everyone else can sing its praises forever, but if you offered me a free meal to go back there, I wouldn't take you up on that offer.\\n\",\n",

Which was shocking since everyone else did. \\n\\nThe food was far from 5 star. I mean it was just so bland. I didn't understand what I was eating. I can honestly say the only good thing was the foie gras. Everything else was pretty bad. Don't waste you're hard earned money on this.  Cheers\\n\",\n",

Every dish was explained with enthusiasm and not hurried. The sommelier was very good in concocting a cocktail to suit the description I gave him, as my husband chose to have a wine pairing to go with his meal.

       " \"We came here on a very cold early afternoon yesterday. I was surprised how easily I got a reservation here, for 1 PM on a Saturday; but I digress. The space of the restaurant was expansive and more old-world styled. The service was excellent as expected in most fine dining restaurants; I appreciated the fact that some sauces and food was prepared or finished table side. \\n\\nThe memorable dishes for me were the pan seared foie gras, which I would rate a 10 of 10. I have had foie gras in the past, but nothing so rich and so quick to dissolve in the mouth like this foie gras. The accoutrements with the foie gras also paired nicely with the richness of this sliver of goodness. The second memorable dish was the Lobster Newberg, whose sauce was prepared table side; our hostess stressed very much how the dish used to be named Lobster à la Wenberg. Anyways, the sauce was prepared with the innards of a lobster head, apple brandy, herbs, and a kind of lobster bisque. The lobster itself was perfectly poached and was brought in separately as the sauce was poured on top of it; the micro mushrooms complimented the dish nicely. \\n\\nThe third memorable dish was the smoked sturgeon dish with it's various side platings, all very beautifully arranged and almost overwhelming. These complemented flavors included a slice of bread with ethereal thinness, caviar with crème fraîche, pickled mackerel, whitefish potato salad, pickled cucumbers with black rye and salmon, and beets with apple and trout roe. Each section had it's own distinct flavor and the thought process was executed well in this set of dishes. \\n\\nThat being said, I want to explain why I gave this restaurant only a 4 star rating. It was not because of service or the environment; it was the remainder of the dishes, most notably the duck. I expected a godly piece of poultry, but I found it much more ordinary than what my expectation believed it to be. The knife given to us was dull and the skin with the flesh wasn't very forgiving to the knife, so I was initially shocked that my knife couldn't even penetrate the duck after 4-5 strokes. The skin was flavored well but not as crispy as I had imagined; the flesh was more tough than tender. The mushrooms were cooked nicely but I wasn't a fan of the thick mushroom mousse that accompanied the duck breast. Maybe this was an off day? I am not entirely sure. \\n\\nWas this a 3 star michelin meal to me? Probably not, but what do I know. I've been to many restaurants but this meal didn't blow me away. Not to say it wasn't good, but it did not exactly match my expectations, as very few restaurants actually do. Would I try Eleven Madison Park again? Yes, perhaps for a summer menu when other produce is available; many of these dishes were root based and perhaps the better weather in the surrounding area will in turn translate to better dishes for my palate? Perhaps, but the next stop on our list is Le Bernardin.\\n\\nThank you for reading this review.\\n\",\n",

The foie gras, usually a favorite, is so rich and tasteless it is completely unappetizing. The tiny piece of lobster is ok, but covered in salty \"bisque.\" The dessert is a good humor bar on one side of the plate and blob of thick whipped cream on the other (\"cookies and cream\"); otherwise you can have \"berries and pears,\" which includes about 5 berries, 3 small pieces of pear with some berry-colored sweet cream balls.

I had a bit of a reviewer\\'s block bc 1) what value could I add that hasn\\'t been said about the amazing EMP? 2) how do I go about critiquing the food w/o offending the die hard fans of this beloved 3M stars haven? And finally 3)  can anyone really justify paying $8 Benjamins for lunch more than once? \\n\\nI\\'ll start with this... I love love love the entire experience, from stepping into what used to be a bank with high ceilings, white glove services (each employee has a job - including Miss Universe (her posture puts me to shame! Ugh...) carrying a tray of forks/spoons/knives for every setting) to the often \"over the top\" presentation and ending with a child\\'s dream in the form of a popsicle!

There was an organic carrot course, where the sous chef comes out and demonstrates with a table top grinder. It\\'s what some have called \"adults playing w/ food\" - presented with fixing such as nuts, seeds, cream.  I am NOT a huge fan of carrots and I\\'ve mentioned that to our server. So needless to say, I had left over.  Apparently that must be a \"frown upon\" thing at these type of establishment (ur a freak if u don\\'t lick ur plate...)  I was \"ASKED\" not once, twice but 4x as to why I didn\\'t finish my carrots?!?!  Server, sous chef assistant, the guy who manages our table, & the water server... Seriously?!  It\\'s carrots... It was tasteless, boring, and not very pleasing.  Was I beyond annoyed? Eff yes!  Bottomline, no one should ever force you to eat uninteresting of anything or \"food shame you\"!

This was actually very, very good. \\n\\nSo 11 Madison loves to show you the plates and how they are cooked. They come by and show me the celery root that was trapped inside a pig bladder and tell me they\\'ll go into the kitchen to serve it. They lie. It\\'s just a show piece. The same show piece I saw at least 15 times that night at different tables. I actually felt bad for the servers that had to repeat the same thing over and over. You can see it in their face. \"Stupid pig ball sack again and again\". \\n\\nAs for the celery root with truffle gravy. Eh. It was ok. \\n\\nBlend of liver patte and cured duck meat. Nice touch. \\n\\nNext is the duck. Another show piece they walk around tables throughout the night. It was a bit tough and hard to cut but the taste was there. \\n\\nCheese. We had 8 types of cheese to choose from. The variety was nice but there was one potent one that smelled and tasted like concentrated fart. Once I cut into it, the aroma seared our nostril hairs. It was pretty raunchy. Other than that, pretty clean and nutty flavors. \\n\\nBaked Alaska. Only real strong complaint of the night. Yet another showpiece I was sick of seeing. Fire was cool. The taste of this thing was... Out right awful. Patrons want dessert. Real dessert. Creme brûlée with a spin. Chocolate something to blow me away. A mousse perhaps, some kind of crazy lava cake. The taste of this was gross. The rum soaked bottom was too strong it become bitter. The Apple flavors just didn\\'t work for me. However, they did say they\\'ll be happy to give us something to substitute. \\n\\nI will say they do whatever it takes to make you happy. If you didn\\'t like something, they would find ways to make it up to you. Service is perfect. Gift bag was nice. Granola was really good. Fancy good. \\n\\nAs for the food, it missed on a lot of marks so the experience was not as remarkable as I thought it\\'d be. Not for the price that was paid.\\n',\n",
       " \"Best food and service stuff. Everything that I ate was delicious. Nice drinks, really well balanced coctails. They really care about your experience. Overall I'd recommend this spot. But first maybe call ahead and check for free seats.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I don't know what I can say about EMP that hasn't already been said in the previous 1,000+ reviews!\\n\\nWe blew in on a cold January night, several minutes before they were technically open, and they welcomed us in and invited us to have a cocktail at the bar until the dining room was ready. My husband got a scotch on the rocks, and OH MY GOD, that was the most BEAUTIFUL ice ball I had ever seen! The bartenders HAND CARVE the ice balls here! I wanted to see it in action (especially after we all raved about it), but alas, our table was ready, and we were whisked away to the dining room.\\n\\nWe were surprised by the details in each of our courses. I wasn't feeling all that great in my tummy, so I had to warn them that I was lactose intolerant when I would normally suck it up and pay for the pain/discomfort later! This was actually a good thing because some of my courses were SO MUCH MORE delicious than that of my friends or my husbands! \\n\\nThey really knocked it out of the park with their super attentive service. This wasn't stuffy pretentious service. This was service that seemed effortless and was at times just downright playful. We were joking that we didn't know what course we were at, and made a comment that we should have boxer girls in bikini's walking through with big number signs! The next thing we knew, the server who was handling the silverware lifted up his tray that had a post-it with a number on it and walked by!! We were DYING with laughter. The guys didn't know what we were laughing about, and the next course the girls had post-it's with a number on the bottom of our plates that we then lifted up for the guys to see! It was AWESOME. And FUN. We had so much FUN here!\\n\\nIt was a four hour dinner that did not feel tedious or boring. Not once did we check phones (except to take enthusiastic pictures of the pig's bladder with celery root). And at the end of our glorious meal, our AMAZING server gifted us not only with the granola and printed menu, but also with individual S'More kits!! We were joking that we should have s'mores since the venison is cooked in this crazy ash/salt crust, and when they bring it out into the dining room to show you, it smells like an amazing campfire. I cannot believe they did that for us, and it really seemed like the servers were having as much fun as we were!\\n\\nThere were a few courses that we didn't enjoy - the seafood was weirdly fishy at times, and I really didn't like the dry sausage/charcuterie course. But there were some AMAZING highlights like their take on pastrami and rye (TO DIE FOR), and their venison (the most tender piece of meat I've ever had - I could have used like 18 pieces of those). The dessert for me wasn't that great (everyone got baked alaska and I got some cloyingly sweet sorbet I couldn't stomach). \\n\\nBut the service really put this meal at one of the best we've had. The service here was even better than the outstanding service we had at Per Se. However, I personally think the food at Per Se was a half step better than EMP. \\n\\nThis really is a 4-figure dinner, and one that was honestly worth every penny!\\n\",\n",
       " 'This is the best restaurant Ive ever been to. \\n\\nThe service people were extraordinarily kind and nice. Also gentle and provided very structured and professional services with knowledge. \\n\\nFood were amazing. They killed it from the first course with four of different amuse bouche. Every single one was amazing and full of its flavor. Then the caviar.. i mean i dont know what to say more than amazing. Every single course was very special and perfectly cooked and served several levels above than you expected. \\n\\nFunny step they had at the end, they offer a 4 different chocolate with different milks and make you guess which milk is used for each chocolate. Its hard to tell but amazing and they give you the answer with check. I think this is the best way to give a check that i  can think of. \\n\\nI will definately go back here whenever i have a chance to. The best.\\n',\n",
       " 'Thoroughly unimpressed.  The service was attentive and overall good.   Following that, and a sturgeon / caviar savory cheesecake, there were few highlights.  Long wait for a drink to start the meal, starters were ok, a bit bland or \"one note\".  The lobster was chewy and lacked flavor.  Veal loin was chewy, almost rubbery and also lacked flavor.  It\\'s unfortunate - we had high hopes, but it looks like EMP has jumped the shark as they say....\\n',\n",
       " 'Outstanding! My wife and I just relocated to the east coast from the food Mecca of Chicago! I am a Chicago native, so I feel confident in saying we visited just about every high end restaurant, as well as delicious hole in the walls in The Chicagoland area. (Yes, we have been to Alinea). \\n\\nAll that being said,  Eleven Madison Park is outstanding. It was well worth every penny! I love the $295 tasting price especially since tip was included. It really simplifies things. \\n\\nWe will be back for sure! Until next time EMP. Please save me some Apple Brandy!\\n',\n",
       " \"I saw Eleven Madison Park as the top rated restaurant in the world and I happened to be in New York so of course I looked up reservations thinking there would be no way to get in on a Saturday evening a few days out. There happened to be a reservation at 10pm, but I didn't snag it as I hadn't gotten my party organized and by the morning, it was gone. I put myself on the waitlist and Friday afternoon, received a call that a spot opened up at 7:45pm. I immediately took it. Score! I was directed to a website (Tock), where you prepay for your meal. \\n\\nWe were a party of four and while the dress code is not enforced, the vibe was formal when we arrived and I wouldn't have felt comfortable wearing jeans and a top. Dressy casual would have been okay though. One of my favorite aspects of the restaurant was the service--comprised of relatively young staff that were gracious, kind, and relatively casual in conversation. \\n\\nBe aware that the meal will take several hours; we arrived at 7:45pm and left at 11:30pm. \\n\\nNow onto the food. We were amazed at the first few courses: beautifully chic and tasteful bites of heaven, including a black and white cookie, truffle, and eggs benedict play with caviar. However, many of the items were very rich, abundantly salted, and some quite buttery, that by the main course, we were craving some balance with lighter fare. I ordered the duck entree while two of my friends ordered the oxtail and while the duck was on the cusp of being too rich, the oxtail was definitely over the top. After the main course, I was actually only able to take a few bites of the rest of the items as it was too rich for myself and another in the party. \\n\\nLastly, we ordered several bottles of wine, including a New York champagne, a white (can't remember which), and a California pinot and the sommelier was fantastic at helping us choose. \\n\\nOverall, I think it's definitely worth it to try, but eleven courses of rich foods was overwhelming for me.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Yes!! Now that it's been rated the world's best restaurant, I feel it's important to report my official findings. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday last October as a surprise and I've never seen him smile that much in our time together. We were greeted at the door by name and escorted to our table by very nice wait staff. We were surrounded by businessmen discussing deals and a few couples looking thrilled to be there as well. The sommelier was amazingly cool; All of the waitstaff were to be honest. I always say and do awkward things, especially when I have to go somewhere nice. They felt like friends (but in a professional way) serving you and really wanting you to enjoy the meal. I've never felt more at ease at a place like this.\\n\\nThe food and the presentations were phenomenal. The wine pairings were excellent. I think we had one of the top ten best pairings(according to our sommelier), it was a port and pate. I was extremely skeptical at first. \\n\\nTo end the night a big bottle of apple brandy was plopped on our table with chocolates and a game of sorts. I absolutely loved the whole experience. Definitely a top dinner for me and I'm pretty sure I've earned a year or two more with my boyfriend because of it. Come here if you can!!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Probably the best dinner of my life so far. The staff was excellent. The food was unbelievable and everyone was super nice, not stuffy at all. The baked Alaska was my favorite part of the meal. They also gave us a bottle of liquor at the end of our meal and told us to stay as long as we wanted. I loved that they were about the experience and not turning the table for the next guest.\\n',\n",

They even sent us home with a keepsake of our dinner and granola. Only downfall, they didn't have the correct date on the keepsake which typically wouldn't matter except it was my birthday. \\nWe'll definitely be back though.\\n\",\n",
       " 'When we first walked in, we were asked \"can we help you?\" like we were lost, homeless people.  Maybe it is my blue hair, casual romper, or top to bottom tattooed body...besides that and the dusty ledge behind us, Eleven Madison Park exceeded my expectations in flavor and service.  We did the tasting menu.  They gave us a tour, unscheduled!  Every single dish was beyond delicious. It is impossible to explain the luxurious flavors we experienced for over three hours.  (P.S.: I took one of each of the dessert treats offered at the end of the meal...why not?) I look forward to possibly coming back someday for the newly renovated restaurant/menu!\\n',\n",
       " \"I came here with high expectations and left not necessarily blown away but still very satisfied.\\n\\nI have to preface this review by saying that Alinea and Manresa are my two favorite restaurants as their dining experience, ingenuity, and ability to surprise not only on flavor but in presentation blows any other restaurant out of the water.\\n\\nEnter EMP where it stands above the rest in the worlds 50 best in the US and is featured all over in documentaries and tv shows. You can say that much was expected.\\n\\nI won't bore you with details but all I can say is that the style is completely different than the gastronomy of the other restaurants I love and instead focuses on simplicity and refinement of classic dishes with slight twists. I've never had a meal that did this and I was impressed since the difficulty level of cooking something eaten so many times and elevating it to the next level without any tricks with foam or sauces or deconstructions is so much higher. \\n\\nThere were no bad dishes that made you scratch your head but instead took comforting dishes you know and love and made them that much better. Add in the amazing non-stuffy service and gorgeous room, you get an experience that makes you comfortable yet spoiled.\\n\\nI still prefer the gastro style with the crazy combinations that make you go wtf?!, but for focused, perfectly executed classic food in a beautiful setting with welcoming service, EMP hits the nail on the head.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I find it a bit ridiculous that I'm writing a Yelp review for a 3-star michelin restaurant. However, just wanted to write that I had a spectacular time! I loved the amuse bouche especially, like the oysters! Every dish was creative and perfect. The entire experience was like a continuous symphony of flavors in my mouth! The place has a lovely ambiance and I truly enjoyed my experience here.\\n\",\n",
       " \"So this review is based on my trip in April. I did go 3 years ago and that time was amazing certainly worth the 3 Michelin stars.  The second time I went wasn't as impressive. Everything was technically good - even delicious but there weren't stand out dishes or super creative dishes. In April the menu was based on a retrospective menu. I had thought it was to be the 11 best dishes over the past 11 years but it was their 11 most important dishes to them not necessarily the best or most creative. I will definitely go again when it's back up to see if they come back with more creativity like the first time I went.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Everything was mindblowing. This has to be one of my most favorite meals EVER! \\n\\nThere were so many memorable items:\\n\\n - the oysters that seems so simple, cooked 3 ways tasted so different depending on the temperature. MINDBLOWING\\n - the simple bread tasted so awesome with the butter that melts on. \\n - deconstructed eggs  benedict with soft quail egg and caviar MINDBLOWING\\n - seared foie gras with apple slices ALWAYS MINDBLOWING\\n - lobster was super tender MINDBLOWING\\n - the root cooked in a calf's stomach MINDBLOWING\\n - the crispy duck skin and moist duck meat MINDBLOWING\\n - black bass super moist MINDBLOWING\\n - cheese inside apple skin MINDBLOWING\\n - the baked alaska set on fire in front of you, with the cripsy outside and ice cream inside MINDBLOWING\\n\\nThe only thing that I was sad about is the dessert. Baked alaska was good but most michelin star places have multiple desserts. They did give us chocolates with different types of milk and a guessing game for us to guess the type of milk. Also they gave us chocolate pretzels and some take home granola. I wish they would've gave us a different type of dessert since I'm not a chocolate fan.\\n\\nOther than that everything was perfect. Be back again next time we're in NYC!!\\n\",\n",
       " \"A year after my trip (well almost, about a month short) I return to finish this review that I never got down to writing. I went in with high expectations, and to be honest, left just a wee disappointed. Everyone says that Eleven Madison Park sets the bar for cuisine in New York City... but really, I preferred Per Se and it wasn't even close. I was even tempted to give this a four star review, but really, that wasn't fair. EMP was excellent. It was best-in-class... it's just, for me at least, Per Se was better.\\n\\nI enjoyed the meal thoroughly. Service was en pointe, flawless, and welcoming. Without going into specific dishes, every dish was creative and intriguing... with their rendition of a 'eggs Benedict' being the most memorable dish I had that day. Eggs, caviar, a light Hollandaise emulsion, ham gelee... all the flavour elements of one of my favourite breakfast items, compacted into a caviar tin. Brilliant. Delicious. Unforgettable.\\n\\nSome of the other dishes though... were a little off-balance for me. A touch too sour, or another a bit too salty... it felt as though the kitchen was trying to push flavours and ideas further and had gone just a little bit too far... meaning dishes were no longer balanced. And balance is so important to me... a harmonious dish with multiple flavours, that's cuisine. So it was a little... I wouldn't say disappointing, but a little surprising to find that I didn't agree with everything the kitchen put out. It might be more me, maybe I just have a conservative palate.\\n\\nBut overall I would recommend dining at EMP in a heartbeat. The service is perfect, and even with the dishes I didn't love, I still liked them and the meal itself was still one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had, in a restaurant or out. \\n\\nDeservedly five stars.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I was fortunate enough to be invited to participate in a celebration dinner at Eleven Madison Park: This is one of the most special dining experiences you will ever have.\\n\\nImpossible to miss is the attention to meticulous detail that is paid here, such as the surprisingly-deep vocab from the sommelier (who knew that you can speak that way about liquid?), to the syncopated delivery of the dishes from the line of waiters, to the origin backstory of every ingredient that rivals those of Marvel.\\n\\nOne thing to note: Some dishes are served in communal fashion. Your waiter will conduct his/her due diligence by asking the table if there are any allergies. I have a shellfish one, which seemed pretty harmless at the time.\\n\\nThis came to head during course #8 as our table lustifully gawked at the seafood medley, consisting of clams, shrimp and other delights-a-la-sea, being served at the table next to us (we were one course behind them). But since I was allergic, we were served an alternative \"fish boil\" -- cue in sad trombone and the simultaneous regret of my party felt for inviting me. :*(\\n\\nThe most memorable dishes here were the Caviar Benedicte and the mason jar granola given to you as a parting gift. \"Really, granola?\" you ask.

       " \"About a 2-2.5: The hubs and I came here to celebrate my birthday (Dinner #2) - I was super excited, as this would be our last 3-star Michelin in NY!  Owned by Chef Daniel Humm, the menu consists of a seasonal tasting menu that focuses on local ingredients.  We were actually a little early for our reservation, and while in the process of directing us towards the bar, another employee kindly stated that if we were ready to begin our dinner experience, we could be seated at that moment - yay!  I really think we received one of the best seats in the restaurants, as instead of facing the entrance way with the 'Exit' signs, we were facing the back of the restaurant where it was open, airy, and a beautiful mosaic on the wall as our focal point.  I loved the large table, as it gives an option to couples whether to sit right next to each other or across :D  When we were seated, we noticed a little box tied with a string - contained our first bite of the evening, which was a savory black and white cookie with apple and cheddar - this was salty and savory and crumbled in your mouth! Next, with our napkin holder, there sat a little egg filled with sturgeon caviar, sabayon and chives - delicious! Afterwards, we had an oyster pie and veolute; scallops marinated with black truffle and leeks; a take on eggs Benedict with egg, caviar, cauliflower and ham, with mini biscuits that were just so addicting and oh-so-cute!!!; foie gras (they ask if you would prefer it to be seared or in mousse form; I requested mousse, but I liked the hubs' seared format, as it was delicious); a made-to-order Waldorf salad with apple, celery, grapes, and walnuts - the apples were shaved with a French shaving machine, and this salad was super refreshing; underneath the salad, the plate was lifted for the next course, a celery bisque that was creamy; we then tried lobster with poached butternut squash and chestnuts; Hen of the Woods mushroom bundle roasted with horseradish; a choice of either the restaurant's signature dish, the roasted duck with collard greens and apple or venison; I was not a fan of either of these entrees, as the duck skin was just way too touch and not flavorful, and the venison was also just not tasty; a little mini 'fondue' set with Cato Corner cheese, melted in a hollowed out squash with a side of mustard and twig-like salted pretzel rolls; Botrytis ice cream with bitter almond and ginger crumble with a spoonful of Josef Vineyard's Riesling; a scoop of milk and honey custard with bee pollen ice cream; and, finally, a cute way to end the night - a chocolate 'Name that Milk' chocolate bar game - you receive a mini card with the restaurant logos and 4 animals (bison, cow, sheep, and goat) - you taste each of the unidentified bars and do a matching game, and the server brings out an answer key - this was SO FUN (and, I WON) AHAHAHA  Just note that the bars are dark chocolate-focused. At the end, we received a little bag of their housemade granola, a little canister of the printed menu, and some sea salt chocolate truffle bars. The staff were all super accommodating, friendly, and had a great sense of humor - we really loved Dean :D I am glad I was finally able to try Eleven Madison out!\\n\\n+eggs Benedict with mini biscuits!\\n+seared foie gras\\n+Waldorf salad\\n+cute 'Name that Milk' game at the end\\n+ask for Dean :D\\n+friendly staff\\n\",\n",

Bad chicken, regardless. (Substitute for a red meat dish for half of the table) \\n\\nNeeded a substitute for foie gras due to one of our diner's being pregnant.

Dining here is an EXPERIENCE.  The way that each course is presented makes dinner an adventure.  The food is delicious and the breakfast granola that they send you home with is also very tasty.

Perhaps the best meal I ever will. \\n\\nEleven Madison Park is the mother of all high end French restaurants in America and deserves every accolade that it has received, which is numerous... more on that later. The art deco decor of Eleven Mad transforms New York's Credit Suisse building into a lavish modern paradise with monstrous windows facing Madison Square Park. This place oozes panache and their service is best in class making Chicago's storied Alinea seem like a savage crew of street junkies.\\n\\nYou must pay to play and the cost is steep at $225.00 per seat, but fear not as this is well worth the price of admission. The multi-course tasting menu seems to wander whimsically from course to course for over four hours with swagger and showcases every food item that screams New York City, many times with welcome accompanied homilies from the waitstaff.\\n\\nThere was not a single bite that I did not completely adore but I would be lying to say that their take on Pastrami did not change my life as a culinary adventurer. The saltiness, the savory, the fact that it was perhaps the greatest single swallow of flavor I have ever taken and alone was worth the cash I ponied up for the meal. I cannot run out of superlatives for this kitchen.\\n\\nAnother otherworldly experience is the Loaded Picnic Basket featuring every item you would ever need for the greatest picnic of all time. Except this picnic basket was loaded by Chef Daniel Humm. Simply unbelievable. \\n\\nI could go on for another 5000 characters easily, but that would simply spoil the surprise and great fun in the experience.

They just name dishes for you to choose from and find out if you're allergic to anything. Then on your table is a box already sitting there with your starting dish. And throughout the evening there's lots of small dishes that come out. And by the end of the 3 hour dinner you're ultra full. Stand out dishes were the mushroom that comes in 4 unique looking plates.

Our waitress was friendly and courteous, also super perceptive to any of our needs. \\n\\nI love love love the duck!! It was tastebud heaven for me. I'd return for that duck.\\n\\nI also love how they bring in a backstory to some of their dishes. It really makes it more special. e.g. the lobster was also amazing where they placed it over crackling fire and a bed of seaweed, then they pour saltwater over the entire thing so that the steam can cook the lobster. The backstory is that this is the traditional New England method of cooking the fresh-catch-of-the-day. Very interesting and the lobster was soo fresh!\\n\\nThe apple brandy with the chocolate guessing game was especially interesting and a great way to end the night. They bring out four different bars of Mast Brothers (my favorite brand of chocolate!) chocolates made from different animal's milk, and the goal is to match the chocolate correctly to the corresponding animal.\\n\\nI took one star off because I did not enjoy some of the dishes I had, but I think that's mere personal preference (Yelp really needs to update this, because I want to give this place 4.5, haha). I personally didn't like the sweet potato. I felt like it didn't suit the entire course. In addition, I also feel that their eggs benedict version of serving caviar ruined the taste of caviar. The ham inside was too overwhelming for me to taste any of the caviar. \\n\\nHowever, there is not a single bad thing I can say about this restaurant overall. I'd definitely return! Best birthday dinner ever!\\n\",\n",
       " \"We came here on probably one of the coldest nights of the year (12/30). We had extremely high expectations, as we've dined in other 3 Michelin Star restaurants that blew us away. EMP was just okay. We were sat by the door and had a chill the entire night. Every time the door opened a cold gust of air would blow in. Not only were we cold, but our food got cold extremely fast. If we didn't eat the course quickly, the food was cold. Not what I would expect from the supposed best restaurant in the world. Don't think it was worth the hype or the price. If you're looking for an unbelievable experience at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant, try Per Se.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Eleven Madison Park is more than a restaurant.  It is the ultimate culinary EXPERIENCE which takes you on an incredible journey of flavors, ingredients, presentation, & service.  This is a bucket list restaurant.  This is a once in a lifetime restaurant.  This is the epitome of a meal experience.  THIS is why we eat.\\n\\nMy Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\\n\\nAtmosphere - Eleven Madison Park is a beautiful & elegant restaurant.  The main dining room is in a large hall, with beautiful flower centerpieces in the middle surrounded by white cloths and custom place setting.  The crowds consist of you share of couples, groups, business diners, and New York\\'s elite.  It\\'s a place where you feel weird (almost embarrassed) to take out your phone to snap photos.  It\\'s upscale, classy, and everyone is dressed accordingly.  1 Star.\\n\\nService - As soon as we walked in and gave them our name, they said \"Happy Anniversary\" and proceeded to give us the most amazing service.  We began by choosing a flavor (strawberry for her & coffee for me).  These flavors would resonate later mysteriously in one of our courses.  It was fun, mysterious, & exciting! Each of the 15 courses has an introduction & explanation - culinary stories if you will.  After each course our table was cleared and all items reset.  There is an army of servers with specific tasks with a head captain leading the way.  1 star.\\n\\nFood - You don\\'t dine at Eleven Madison Park.  You EXPERIENCE it.  It\\'s so hard to explain as I\\'ve never had a meal like this.  This is fine dining that combines an inventive menu with unique ingredients, textures, & cooking techniques that you\\'ve only heard or read about.  Our meal included items such as savory cookies to start, potato chip crème fresh, coffee cola, pastrami, poached lobster, & more.  To attempt to describe the dish would be an injustice to the actual experience.  The meal ends with sweet cookies, a custom menu, a full belly, and an evening you will never forget.  Make time though - the dinner lasts about 3 hours.  2 Stars.\\n\\nWill I Return? - Yes (if I win the lottery).  Normally I would say no because this experience comes at a very lofty price; however, it\\'s a place you go to experience the grand possibilities that can be created by food.  In all likelihood I will probably not make it back, but it doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t want too.  You may not like everything on your menu, but no doubt you\\'ll be talking about your experience for years. 1 Star.\\n\\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I\\'ll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that\\'s also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It\\'s important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I\\'ll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it\\'s really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I\\'ll return, I\\'ll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \\n\\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.\\n',\n",

This meal was ok.... at best. But for the price tag, I was hoping for much more than \"ok\". Sure, the service was decent (they wished my husband \"happy birthday\" every time he breathed so I couldn\\'t call it inattentive) but compared to the service at my husband\\'s birthday dinner last year at Per Se (during which, the staff made us feel like royalty) this was forced and bordering on uncomfortable. The dishes themselves were lackluster. Honestly, I can\\'t remember anything I ate (please note I didn\\'t drink that night because I\\'m breastfeeding and I keep a very detailed food journal to remember my favorite meals... so for me to not remember something? Not cool for a restaurant of this caliber.) Best thing I ate was the granola they sent us home with for breakfast. I\\'ve dined at most of the world\\'s top 10 restaurants (here is my metric: https://m.theworlds50best.com/index.html) and this is the only one I would absolutely not return to.

       " 'I have made it a rule not to review restaurants where I am an invited guest.  Today I am making an exception.  Eleven Madison Park, at the southern end of the Original Madison Square Garden, is the perfect location for a New American but truly international dining establishment.  This is truly one of the best restaurants in both New York, and the country!  I have always said that it is about the food, but let me say it starts here with the atmosphere and service which is unmatched in NYC.  I love the spacious tables and the old school space worthy of Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt himself!\\n\\nThis is a perfect restaurant for a romantic rendezvous or a marriage proposal.    The caviar appetizer was exquisite, and the warm salad with mushrooms, pine nut, and kale combined a wonderful presentation with a medley of fresh, rustic flavors.  My main course of roasted beef with root vegetables and black truffle was truly memorable.  It was perfectly seared retaining its flavor and cutting perfectly.  The dessert was very flavorful and subtle: Tart Tatin with Hibiscus Caramel and Creme Fraiche Ice Cream worthy of Paris, France.  Eleven Madison Park is truly a special place worthy of the Annals of Madison Square Garden!  It was a perfect place for  me to connect/reconnect with many other Double Hoyas!  If you are looking for a classy but friendly location this is the place!\\n',\n",
       " 'This is a challenging review because while everything was good, great even, it just didn\\'t seem like enough. When I think back to my first experiences at Nobu, Rogue 24, Blue Hill, Gramercy Tavern, and Craft, among others, there was something special and almost magical about them. This was really good, but it was not magical.\\n\\nTo start with the atmosphere, it\\'s the epitome of fine dining. High ceilings, beautiful room, plenty of space between the tables, but staid. Where is the soul? Sitting couples on the same end of the table was unusual, but worked.\\n\\nService was impeccable, everyone was very friendly and from beginning to end more than happy to fulfill our requests, from more bread to menu substitutions.\\n\\nThe $295 \\'reserve\\' wine pairing was a disappointment. While the refills were much appreciated, I was perhaps expecting something more special from it than $30-60 bottles, most from the past few years.\\n\\nOnto the food, the most important part.\\n\\nThe savory black and white cheddar amuse-Bouche was interesting, but were slightly too reminiscent of Nabisco crackers.\\n\\nthe next course was four more small bites. The celery root with black truffle and the parsnip pie were delicious, though it feels weird to haven been served two renditions of celery root with black truffle during the meal. The other two bites were good, but not amazing.\\n\\nNext I had the caviar \"Benedict\" with pickled egg yolk, ham, and a bite sized English muffin. Ingredients aside, nothing about the dish was reminiscent of an eggs Benedict, but it was still quite enjoyable. My girlfriend had a cauliflower and black truffle substitute that was good, but very cauliflowery.\\n\\nThe celery root with black truffle braised tableside in a pigs bladder was definitely the highlight of the meal, both in taste and presentation. \\n\\nThe striped bass (or lobster, depending on your choice) was delicious, as was the venison, though the blood sausage served with the venison was not very prominent.\\n\\nFor dessert, we split a baked Alaska which was flambayed tableside. It was very good, but we couldn\\'t help but wonder where the rest of it had gone when it reappeared on our plates with just 20% of what was originally flambayed.\\n\\nThe chocolates at the end were good, as was the game, though given its scandals they could have done better than mast brothers. I definitely appreciated them leaving a bottle of apple brandy at the table at the end.\\n\\nSending us home with granola and a menu was a good end to the meal, though I must say I was a little surprised to find we were charged $10 a Coke when the check came, but such is life.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dare I say that EMP is overrated?\\n\\nI feel that while eating here was a fun experience, it was as much about the schtick as the food itself. Yes, it was fun getting a picnic basket, or grilling fruit, or having a clam boil right at the table... but I can get that stuff for a whole lot less than $300 per person at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant. I guess what I\\'m saying is at this level of restaurant I want to be blown away by the food, the chef\\'s technique, and the best ingredients in the world, and I do not think that EMP delivered on that. Sorry.\\n\\nPS - My wife got all 4/4 in the \"guess the milk\" game (I got 0/4... I suck). She told me to add that. We ate here like 3 months ago and she\\'s still bragging about it.\\n',\n",
       " 'Dang....3.5 hrs for so little food.  Sigh. \\n\\nReally sad to say this, but our tasting menu tonight was pretty underwhelming. There were a lot of creative pickling and small portions of veggies which were garnished n beautifully presented ....but failed to follow through in taste. The \"tomato in oil\" dish was too concentrated n acidic; it was pretty much like eating a fancy version tomato paste. There was a mini pickled eggplant and then another pickled sunflower heart. OMG. \\n\\nThe desserts were more salty than sweet.  \\n\\nThere were so many courses, but each were pretty much bite size. I did not need 15 mins each to eat them. Actually, I didn\\'t eat half of the meal. \\n\\nTo their credit, the fois gras with the fried shallot crumble was AMAZING, so was the corn/cream/caviar dish. The duck was good, but we each only got a sliver of it....what happend to the rest of the duck?? The seafood boil was made well, but had a bunch of, again, seemingly pickled veggies and only a few pieces of real meat. \\n\\nThe fois gras proves that they\\'ve got skills here at EMP, but their creative culinary artistry got ahead of them. Instead of presenting their diners with an ensemble of delicious and satisfying dishes, I felt we were guinea pigs here to pay A LOT to taste a food experiment. \\n\\nThere were a lot of \"womp womp WOMP\" moments. I felt teased. And I left not full....and I am a small person. \\n\\nI apologize. I know I\\'m ranting. \\n\\n*the extra star is for the impeccable service and gorgeous décor.\\n',\n",

They only had a 10pm slot available but since we were flying in from SF that afternoon, it was really 7pm in our timezone, so we grabbed it!  And due to our 10pm rezzie, we were also able to fit in a Play beforehand - worked out so well, all around!!\\n\\nAs we arrived, the place was still hopping at 10pm.  We left around 1:30am & weren\\'t even the last ones there!\\n\\nVegetarian Tasting Menu was on the docket!!

The cookie had cheddar in it & it provided a fantastic mix of sweet & savory\\n\\nPears w walnut powder & balsamic dollop - this was tart & refreshing\\n\\nApples & horseradish w/ apple snow - extremely inventive - the \"snow\" provided a sweetness that was countered by the spicy horseradish - lovely\\n\\nMushroom sabayon w/ chives oil & diced mushrooms served in egg shell - very rich & creamy\\n\\nToasted shittake mushroom w/ peanut potatoes & quail egg, everything bagel w/ pickles & cucumber cream cheese on toast - getting into more of the savory, spiced part of our meal, this was heaven.....plus, it was paired w/ this wonderful homemade maple soda!\\n\\nSunchoke salad w/ crispy sunchoke & a buttermilk vinaigrette foam\\n\\nWaldorf salad - This was prepared at the table from scratch - apple, celery root, lemon, mayo, candied walnuts, cranberries.  Loved their interpretation!\\n\\nUnder the bowl was another hidden/surprise bowl of crispy grains & yogurt - 2nd version of salad that was more like an apple-granola cereal w/ a yogurt dollop in the hidden spoon\\n\\nParsnip crunch; parsnip pana cotta w black radish; parsnip w/ horseradish \\n\\nParsnips w quinoa & mushrooms - I really liked the nuttiness of the quinoa w/ the earthiness of the mushrooms\\n\\nCelery root ball w/ celery root purée & black truffle jus - you add truffle jus to anything & I\\'m going to be a fan!\\n\\nFreekah broth w/ a rye crisp & gruyere, pickles, mustard seeds - can\\'t say I\\'ve ever had freekha before but I liked it - a nice nutty grain that was also tender & like a barley\\n\\nFreekah Risotto w/ a crispy something on top & black sesame purée\\n\\nPicnic basket w/ runny cow cheese that we could have bathed in it was so good, plus a fruit & nut cake & a sweet onion jam - paired w/ their homemade wheat pale ale.

       " \"My EMP review is loong overdue but I will be returning there next week and the anticipation stirred up all the memories of delicious food.  I have been lucky enough to dine at EMP 3 times and each time I left in awe of the quality of service and the stream of insanely perfect dishes I received.  \\n\\nThe first time I went waaay back in 2013, it was my first 3-star Michelin experience and they had recently updated the menu to the current New York-themed presentation.  I really thought i had died and gone to foodie heaven.  Each dish was more amazing than the next and the staff made us feel extra special without being overbearing.  I am a huge meat eater but the carrot tartare is one of my favorite restaurant dishes of all times.  It was so simple yet so complex and fun to make.  We had opted for lamb that night and with the bread they brought two types of butter, one made with the lamb renderings.  Ohhhh myyyy gawwwd that lamb rendering butter put every other butter to shame (and beats out the duck fat and steak version also so served by EMP).  It wasn't until my third visit that I tried the lavender and fennel crusted duck and definitely lived up to the hype - so tender, so flavorful, and just the right balance of floral notes from the lavender and bite from the fennel.  I normally don't like floral flavours in my food hence why my hesitation to initially order it but wow it was good.  My third visit may have also been my favorite.  We were there for my mother's birthday and they treated us like royalty making sure our every need was taken care of and doing extra things to make us feel special.  \\n\\nSince my first visit I've been to a number of the other 3-star NYC restaurants and EMP remains my favourite.  Why?  Because they create an atmosphere where a 4-5 hour dinner feels like a fleeting hour of just amazing food and fun.  There is no stuffiness or air pretentiousness here.  If you look around, every one is having a good time, including the staff.  No one blinks twice if you ask them what an ingredient is or how something is prepared.  You just don't get that at a lot of high end restaurants here. I can only hope my next visit will be just as on point as the rest and EMP will continue to be one of my favorite dining experiences in the world.\\n\",\n",

       " 'It was supposed to be my foodie dream come true. I waited and waited for a very special occasion to finally come to EMP. After 8 years in the city, it was actually happening. I matched to my dream residency and my fiancé surprised me on the same morning while I was still in tears with the reservation. When he asked me if I wanted to go, I teased him that we needed to make a reservation 28 days in advance and we can\\'t just walk in - he then told me he actually made one while we were still in Canada. Yep I\\'m marrying this one. \\n\\nWe were warned to save our belly by friends and were told actual dinner would last up to 4 hrs. We arrived promptly for our reservation and were seated immediately. They then presented us an envelop where we were to select an ingredient to be incorporated in our tasting menu. My fiancé went with maple and I went with cranberry. Then our food journey begin. \\n\\nBlack/white savory cookie - tasted just like Ritz cheese crackers\\n\\nOysters - really bland, lemon and cocktail sauce might actually taste better\\n\\nScallop - the apple sorbet was so overpowering, could have put anything under and I wouldn\\'t know what I was eating\\n\\nBeef - actual bone with stuffed tartare. Tasty but not memorable\\n\\nPastrami - made my own open face sandwich, a waste of a course to be honest. Paired with maple and cranberry soda - both screamed diabetes \\n\\nFoie gras - our waiter actually forgot that one of us wanted it seared. When my fiancé and I grabbed his attention and asked since our dishes looked exactly the same and we actually didn\\'t know what seared one was supposed to look like - our waiter thought that I was being difficult and changed my mind - he kinda just rambled on how he thought he established that we both wanted cold which wasn\\'t true and just ended the misunderstanding with an extra order of seared foie gras for my fiancé and I to share. He never actually acknowledged his mistake and it seemed our convo was cut short. But I guess I can\\'t complain about free foie gras. Cold foie gras - again really plain and couldn\\'t tell for my life what I was eating. Seared much better - especially when I smother a thick cut of it on top of their house made bread. But it wasn\\'t anything special - Asiate\\'s had this beat hands down\\n\\nApple - a bit too sour but made Bleu cheese tasted ok (I hate Bleu cheese)\\n\\nLobster - the lobsters were so overcooked. It almost flew out of my plate when I was sawing it\\n\\nCelery root - 1 of the better dishes of the night and it was the truffle mushroom cream not the celery root itself.\\n\\nDuck - We chose the duck over the pork for our main course. started us off with duck broth and a cracker with foie gras and cheese. Both a treat! The duck broth had a layer of oil but the taste was light and flavorful. Main dish - Even though I loved the herb seasoning on top of the skin, my duck was cold and the meat was tough. This was supposed to be the star of my tasting? The side cup of foie gras pudding was really rich and flavorful - I enjoyed dipping more bread into it but straight up spooning and eating it would be impossible. \\n\\nGreensward - presented in a whimsical picnic basket - sparking cider + fruit cake + onion jam. Not enough pretzel to go with all the pairing. When I asked and waited for a second serving of pretzel, another waiter came by and was ready to clear the table. When he learned that we were waiting for more bread and he seemed really surprised \"o really?\". Yes I know we are more than half way in in our tasting and I stuffed my face with 6 rolls. But there are 4/5 of the cheese, jam, and fruitcake left and I will eat. \\n\\nSweet potato - should have named this espresso because the taste of the espresso meringue overpower everything else\\n\\nBaked Alaska - beautiful lighting presentation by the table. They incorporated the maple and cranberry that we chose in the beginning of the tasting by splashing a bit of the maple cream and cranberry sauce onto the dish. The rum cream again overpowered everything else. The maple tasted like a shot of caramel sauce \\n\\nChocolate pretzel + black and white sweet cookies - can probably find these in Walgreen and have handful of them all to myself\\n\\nService was acceptable but felt a bit ignored (I had to struggle getting in and out of my seat) perhaps it was because the 3 tables around us all got wine pairing. They gifted us a jar of housemade granola and a box of peanut butter chocolate with a slip of Congratz to go. A nice touch but we saw every table got one. Taste wise - My fiancé and I expected so much more a Michelin 3 stars. Nothing was memorable. There wasn\\'t a moment where I took a bite, my eyes lit up, grabbed my fiancé\\'s hands and said \"omg u have to try this\". Sad to say but we had better food in the city during Restaurant Week. It was a reservation that I\\'ve always dreamed of but only to learned that the dream was much better than reality.\\n',\n",

I went into Eleven Madison Park expecting to have my taste buds spoiled and my mind blown (especially since my previous New Year's Eve dinners at Jean George and Bouley were spectacular), but I ended the meal feeling completely underwhelmed. The highlights of the meal were the play on Eggs Benedict with caviar, which was buttery and whimsical and the Foie Gras was smooth and savory at first bite and then left your tongue with a sweet aftertaste. Unfortunately, the low was the main course. The menu listed Venison, which I don't eat. The waitress was kind enough to make a substitution of either a vegetarian option or fish. I selected the fish and I now wished I went with the vegetarian option or just kept the venison. The halibut was served lukewarm to cold and lacked flavor. All I tasted was salt and too much of it. It was accompanied by a glazed beet that was just ok. The dessert which was custard with bee pollen ice cream that hid a small ball of honey. It was nice but nothing to rave about.  \\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere was lovely and the waitstaff was courteous and friendly; the meal just left me disappointed especially for the amount that you are paying - $300 +. However, I am happy that I tried Eleven Madison Park (it was definitely on my restaurant bucket list) and I am happier to cross it off my list and leave at that.\\n\",\n",
       " 'My heart aches as I write this review.\\n\\nI had been wanting to pay EMP a visit for a very, very long time. I did a few hours ago, and can\\'t say that I feel anything but underwhelmed (well, that and my wallet being $320 lighter).\\n\\nEverything was just... okay. Not bad by any means, but if I\\'m dishing out hundreds of dollars for what has been purported as a mind-blowing, life-changing meal, I expect my mind to be blown and my life to be changed. EMP failed quite tragically on both accounts, which makes me vraiment triste.\\n\\nThe funny thing is, right before our meal, my friend and I guessed what \"trendy\" ingredients we thought would show up on the tasting menu. Foie gras? Check. Sea urchin? Yes ma\\'am. Celery root, truffle, rutabaga? You betcha. That\\'s the problem with EMP - when your food becomes predictable, you\\'re in trouble. Restaurants like EMP aren\\'t supposed to follow the trends, they\\'re supposed to pioneer them. Sadly, we saw too much of the former and not nearly enough of the latter tonight. One can only hope they aren\\'t making the same mistakes Per Se (and many others) have.\\n',\n",

We had difficulty picking a favorite from all the dishes including the clambake and the carrot tartare.\\nThe service was extraordinary including Pam, the sommeliere and his \"Manhattan cart,\" and, to top it off, we were given a tour of the kitchen including a specially-prepared whiskey sour with a liquid nitrogen gas-frozen concord grape ball that melted in our mouths as we sipped the whiskey sour.\\nThank you for an outstanding experience.

       " 'EMP lived up to its lofty status and reputation as being a top ten restaurant in the world. The meal spanned nearly five hours and was not only a culinary adventure, but also performance art and entertainment. You will pay dearly with your wallet, but EMP represents a restaurant that you won\\'t soon forget. \\n\\nFood: There is no menu. You are presented with two choices out of the approximately 14 course meal: How you want your foie gras prepared (seared or terrine) and your choice of duck or veal (represents the \"main\" course that the whole table shares. Every course was unique and included only the freshest ingredients and creative presentations. I won\\'t go into detail into each course as the photos of the menu and each course tells the story, but we all agreed that the highlights were the caviar eggs benedict, carrot tartar, and the duck. But each and every one of the courses was exciting, interesting, and delicious! \\n\\nDrinks: You can also choose to order alcohol a la carte or opt for wine/beverage pairings that start at $150 and go up from there. We opted for the $150 pairing that included pairings for half of the courses, which ended up being more than enough as they were generous with the pourings and top-offs (more on beverages below). The sommelier was attentive and extremely knowledgeable and we enjoyed unique wines from all over the world that we would likely have not tried anywhere else. We especially enjoyed the white wine served with the pike and the red wine served with the duck (That included the sommelier melting off the neck of the bottle - super cool!). \\n\\nService: Impeccable. A whole army of servers seamlessly integrated with the meal and were never intrusive. Appreciated their willingness to joke and have some fun. All questions and requests were answered promptly. Perfect 10. \\n\\nAmbience: Elegant, lofty space with tables spread apart and with all of the accompaniments of a 3 michelin star restaurant. The noise level become progressively higher the later it got (our reservations were at 6:30) as the restaurant steadily became more crowded. The energy in the room also grew as well.\\n',\n",

Everything about the decor is elegant; I loved the high ceilings, which added to the spacious atmosphere. \\n\\nThe food was indescribably out of the world. Each dish was a piece of art - some standouts were the play on a breakfast egg's benedict with caviar and the duck. I still dream of that piece of duck to this day. You can tell how much time and effort the entire team puts into creating each dish - everything is perfectly detailed, balanced, and whimsical in aesthetics and taste. Additionally, each dish was perfectly portioned - you don't feel that you're going into a food coma when you leave, which happens quite often for tasting menus. A quick tour of the kitchen was the perfect ending to our dinner. \\n\\nThey recently updated their reservation system on their website, allowing for you to see what's available per day on a calendar.

However for the price, my expectation is that it should stand out, and provide a memorable and unique experience.  After eating here, I can say that everything was fine, but nothing was exceptional or creative, except for the Tomato Tea.  In this category, you are paying for something that should be as good as per se, Joel robuchon, Lebernadin, Daniel, Alain Ducase, etc..  I\\'ve been to all of these places and every one of them had something you would remember a year later.  I realize it is not a \"French\" restaurant, but for this price, that list of places are the comparables, and if you disagree then what do we compare this to?  Here, the food presentation was lacking. The flavors are great, but not distinguishing at this level. The service was just OK, but impersonal and functional to the point where a robot would have been more appreciated, and memorable (unlike the food). Dine here, and comment on it, but help others by giving  your relative impression of other $300 restaurants rather than just describing their menu in isolation. If you are going to spend that kind of money, spend it on the best $300 restaurant.\\n',\n",

Every person eating the evening we were there were celebrating something special or keeping up a tradition.  I was there with two of my dearest friends for monumental life reasons that are private, but the are ours to share.\\n\\nEvery bite was full of thought and flavor.

It was a strange way to begin.\\n\\nThe following courses were caviar, foie gras and butter poached lobster, which were the three hits of the night.  \\n\\nThe main was halibut for me, which was served cold (unintentionally) with a sad beet next to it and was total miss.

That something else was a chocolate covered pretzel that ended the experience in a flat way. \\n\\nThis was the first restaurant I\\'ve been to where tipping is neither expected or accepted and I felt a big difference in the quality of service because of it.  The sommelier, who was great took a course to show up and at the end we were offered coffee or tea while mid-dessert.  No one checked in to see what we thought of anything during the dinner.\\n\\nMy friends and I ended up going to get comfort food after since our meal wasn\\'t outwardly satisfying or filling.

The maitre d emailed me days before our reservation to inquire about our visit and ensure we were personally welcomed when arriving at the restaurant.

It was also apparent that the dining room manager (Alex) took pride in his establishment, as he took the time to walk the restaurant and speak attentively with guests.\\n\\nThe food quality and presentation was fantastic.

Standout courses included caviar (benedict with egg, ham, and asparagus), carrot (tartare with rye crisps and condiments), asparagus (braised in pig\\'s bladder with potato and black truffle), lobster (butter-poached with dandelion and ginger), and veal (dry-aged with ramps and bone marrow).\\n\\nWhile finishing the final menu item by playing the famous \"name that milk\" game, Alex came to our table and handed us a key (literally) that unlocked a private experience after dinner concluded.

I cant see any from my table. Those servers should be really good at chatting. Ours checked in with us a couple of times, and then we just watched him swung to another table. Some courses came so late, i felt like we had to wait 30mi for a dish. People came after us finished before that.\\n\\nTaste. A paper board, take out the one you like. I heard some people saying their was the one you don't like. I guess Michelin raters are fond of this sort of things. Started with a black and white cookie, which was sour. I guess this is the part where they wants to surprise you and reset your palate. There were caviare in an egg white, 4 small dishes in a course. Your drink, fresh maid juice, depends on the elements you choose at the beginning. Main dish was either duck or deer. The duck one was so hard to cut with the knife. Covered with sichuan pepper. I was impressed how they can eliminate the taste of the pepper completely. Dessert, with demonstration, flaming cream cake. You get two pieces. What do you think these restaurants do with the remaining?\\n\\nThe whole thing took us 4.5 hours. Drove us nuts.\\n\",\n",
       " 'It been over a month (had the New Years Eve first seating dinner) since I was at Eleven Madison.  I am certain by their ratings on Yelp and international ranking in multiple other surveys that on a normal day this is a great restaurant.  However, in my experience, I was let down. I will give the excuse that it is a completely different experience to serve tables in a restaurant who come in at various times throughout the opening hours as opposed to serving the entire restaurant at the same time. This is where a good gala or wedding venue can prevail.\\n\\nThis was not the first time I have had New Years Eve dinner during a restaurant wide seating at a top notch, highly rated and upscale venue.  In fact it was the fifth year my friends and I have chosen to start our NYE off with a first seating dinner in advance of our other plans.  All of the restaurants in the four years prior who generally function in the same daily manner as Eleven Madison Park (scattered booking times as opposed to a set seating time) have more than succeeded and surpassed at keeping their quality and service well above the standard during their NYE seatings.\\n',\n",

Amazing food, service, decor--there's a reason it's consistently one of the best restaurants in the world. \\n\\nApparently this was the year of splurging on food w/ Ko + EMP but totally worth it. I won't go into detail about all the courses... I can say it didn't start out mind blowing but by the end I was sooo food happy. I LOVED their eggs benedict w/ quail egg and caviar, it was just perfect. One of two foods that have ever made me close my eyes as I just enjoyed the taste. Seafood boil and duck entree really shone as well. Best. Duck. Ever. Minus the too small of a piece because I could have gone ham on that whole duck. \\n\\nAs for desserts, the whey sorbet was pretty interesting... Humm and his team do an amazing job of making combinations of flavors work and whey for dessert is a prime example. Sour and very strong flavor on its own but perfectly balanced when eaten with the caramel and toffee bits on the bottom. The milk chocolate w/ the MAST Brothers collaboration is a fun touch, but IMO goat's milk and sheep's milk chocolate are disgusting. Not my thing; couldn't get past just one bite of the sheep's milk one. The pretzels at the end were incredible--how do they get that texture?? I was about to grab the ones left over at the table beside us. Can take the girl out of the hood but can't take the hood out of the girl. Just pretending to be fancy at EMP. \\n\\nLunch took 4 hours and rounded out with a take-home baggie w/ a jar of granola and a printout of the day's tasting menu. Sister and cousin got chocolate bars as well to celebrate their belated birthdays!

The waiter was nice and he introduced us to different chefs and u got to see their work stations.

       " \"The food and presentation was excellent but I wouldn't say the best. I don't know how restaurants of this caliber can't understand how awkward it is to give one table all the attention for their special occasion and not give another the table anywhere near. It appeared the table next to us was celebrating a birthday and EMP pulled out all the stops while we were on a honeymoon which I would hope happens less often than a birthday does for people. Not one thing special was done for us. I have been here previously for a birthday and my boyfriend at the time was very excited to bring me and told them of the celebration and the same issue where we saw other being given the special treatment. Also this time was given the bill before finishing our champagne. At that, our third bottle. Made us feel like they wanted us to leave. Oh well, it was fine. Plenty of other places in the world to go. Alinea in Chicago far exceeds in terms of food and service.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I have to say that I was quite disappointed with my experience at this \"3 Michelin Star\" restaurant. The place itself is beautiful. But, The food was ok and I was let down by the service. My sister and I went to celebrate her birthday and showed up on schedule for our reservation. We were seated at a table at the corner of the room, sitting at two corners facing the entire room. I know this may be a matter of preference but it was quite uncomfortable facing all the other diners sitting in the room. As we sat down, we noticed a bunch of wrapped gifts in the middle of the table. Then, we sat waiting....watching the waitstaff walking back and forth and watching the other diners eat. It may have only been a few minutes but, it felt awkwardly long before someone approached us to let us know that our first course was in the presents and they needed to be unwrapped. Quirky fun presentation but, just aggravating that we waited so long. Moving on, I am used to having either a set menu or ordering a la carte at a Michelin. The menu here consists of three courses and you chose from two options each course. Again, this may be preference but I felt pressured to pick the better one not knowing which one would be better. My sister and I ended up picking opposite items for each course in order to try everything. Each course was hit or miss but overall underwhelming. Again, I understand taste is a matter of preference so I will not go into details. So, I would like to elaborate on the service. The staff was courteous but pretty stiff, which made the experience feel pretentious. I\\'ve been to several Michelin restaurants in Europe and the U.S. and my experience has been that staff is usually genial and/or entertaining. They make you feel comfortable and welcome, which I didn\\'t feel here. And, the mini donut with candle was a disappointing \"birthday\" surprise for my sister. To top it off, I ordered a small coffee at the end of my meal and I was presented with a check (since we ordered additional wine). No coffee until I had to ask about it. Overall, I\\'m not sure why Eleven Madison Park is ranked number one, toppling that lovely restaurant in Modena, Italy. This was a let down...\\n',\n",
       " \"The atmosphere, location, and service were exactly everything I expected from this restaurant and kitchen! But if I am being bluntly honest besides the service and hospitality provided. The food was, I hate to say it but DISAPPOINTING.. don't get me wrong I understand the courses were simple and elegant and I enjoyed it but the flavor profiles and textures just didn't come through for me and my husband. They're were some outstanding things but very few. Wasn't worth the money. If I knew what we were getting we would have just gone to Chicago and dined at GRACE again if it hadn't closed due to the management issues. Sorry Chef Daniel Humm. But we just weren't pleased with the food..\\n\",\n",
       " \"Came to the fabled Eleven Madison Park for an industry networking event recently, and it was quite an experience. They had a number of passed hors d'oeuvres that we're all delicious - I think my favorite was the carrot ginger. Following that, there was a 7 course chef's tasting menu (including a cheese course and dessert) that was prefixed with an amuse bouche. Of all, I think the first course, kale with smoked pork, was my favorite - and I'm not the biggest fan of kale by a long shot. The beef was cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the lobster course was tough, and the bass was a bit fishy. \\n\\nThe service was impeccable, and the space was graciously appointed. The Pinot Noir provided for the night was thin, flat, and had finish of dry pineapple. I know the wine was selected from a list by the hosting company in order to keep costs reasonable, but if you have dedicated sommeliers and cellarmasters, you surely can find a bargain wine that doesn't immediately taste like a $5.99 clearance rack special. The Cabernet Sauvignon offered, though, was excellent and paired well with much of the dinner. \\n\\nOver all, I was pleased with Eleven Madison Park, but I thought it was overpriced for what it offers. I've had other tasting menus for $200 that were tastier and prepared better, so there's one star off. Much of this is splitting hairs though, if you're interested in this place definitely go and try it out for yourself.\\n\",\n",
       " 'My 400th review goes to Eleven Madison Park. I really wish I could give EMP a 5-star review, but you will learn why in this review:  My friend and I celebrated our birthdays here. We called 28 days in advance and got at 10 pm reservation. This place can easily be missed, just remember the entrance is right at the corner of Madison and an alley.  We arrived right on time and were greeted by a line of employees. It was like they rolled out the red carpet for us. \\n\\nThe first course was actually the black and white cookies since it was our birthdays. They tasted like Cheez-its, which was good because I was afraid that it was going to be sweet.  \\n\\nOyster - This was ok - didn\\'t wow me, but you could tell it was very fresh. They did serve this really cold - I was shivering after this. \\n\\nSea Urchin - (Marinated with shrimp , foie gras and Chervil) To be honest, I didn\\'t remember this dish, come on there\\'s 15 other dishes to remember! \\n\\nSturgeon- (Sabayon with chive oil, smoked with everything bagel crumble, pickles and caviar).  This was served in a little egg shell, it was cute.  The texture was creamy and the chive oil was on the bottom so you do have to stir it.  \\n\\nFoie Gras- (Terrine with plum and bitter almond)  I usually like my foie gras seared but this dish was unique.  It was a terrine foie gras, served in between a thin piece of cracker.  The cracker was really sweet and it might have over powered the foie just a little.  You couldn\\'t really taste the foie because of how sweet the cracker was. I was a little bit disappointed with this dish.\\n\\nCarrot tartare- The waiter Jesse came our table to pureed the carrot for us. There were condiments such as garlic, radish, sesame, and so much more.  They were literally asking you to play with your food, because you are deciding how you want your Carrot Tartare to taste with the rye bread, which by the way was perfect.  It was one fun dish to explore!\\n\\nLobster- (poached with Brussels sprouts). The lobster was sweet and cooked just right. The Brussels Sprouts was my favorite from this dish.  It was cooked well and had a sweet taste to it, because it was paired with light sauce. \\n\\nSquash- (Roasted with cranberries and sourdough)  When we got the kitchen tour they were showing us how they were making this dish. I love squash so this dish was delicious. It was firm and not too soft.  \\n\\nDuck- (Grilled with onion, corn and Lardo. Roasted with Turnip and huckleberries.)  I was very disappointed with this dish because the crust of the duck was so hard.  The huckleberries actually made the dish a little too sour for me. But my friend thought it was too salty.  \\n\\nGreensward- This was by far my most favorite dish. As simple as it may sound, the pretzel was perfect.  This was served in a picnic basket and they said \"we will allow you to explore this basket\".  We didn\\'t know what to expect.   I believe that all their products in the basket was made upstate or in New Jersey and is catered to EMP. The cheese, pretzel and beer will blend perfectly in your mouth.  \\n\\nMalt- Ok I lied, THIS was my favorite dish that I\\'ve ever had. This egg cream tops everything that I\\'ve ever had out of all the fancy restaurants I\\'ve been. The egg cream with vanilla and Seltzer so delicious. I wish I knew how they made it. Okay , I\\'m lying again, I saw them make it, but I really wish I\\'d saved drops of this dessert to analyze how they made it. It wasn\\'t too sweet and it was so smooth, light and creamy. It was like a party in your mouth, not just any party like a crazy Great Gatsby party! \\n\\nApple Sorbet with bay leaf crème brulee and hibisicus. This dish was really good as well. You can tell the sorbet was made fresh in house along with the crème brulee. \\n\\nSweet Potato cheesecake with honey and chestnut.  Yes, you read that right: sweet potato cheesecake with honey and chestnut. The three things I love in life.  I love chestnuts and I love cheesecake. Blend those two together with my third favorite ingredient in life, and you get perfection. \\n\\nWe got the kitchen tour and they showed us around. And Nina made us a drink called Aviation.  It was so good, it was pretty cool crushing up the dry ice for this drink and I think it went well with the dishes that were served after the tour.\\n\\nThey end the night with a magic show which I prefer not to spoil it for you. Just don\\'t blink.  But overall the service was impeccable. It was like they were trained to perfection even the presentation of the food was perfect.   The only problem I had was with the wine: they didn\\'t even ask us to taste the wine at first before serving it. We didn\\'t really like our wine, because it was a little flat. They give you a jar of granola for your breakfast the next day to continue your tasting adventure! Overall, Thank You EMP for an unforgettable birthday experience and for the gift!\\n',\n",

If this place costed $150/person and the taste was what it was, I\\'d probably give them 3.5/5 stars (just for taste). \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, all the plates was prepped very well. I could tell that they use fresh ingredients and prepped it right there and then. And their plating and display game? Totally on point! But the taste was nothing special. Some of the plates were bit salty so we didn\\'t even finish them (mind you, this is the tasting menu!). And the most disappointing thing was that we had to send our main entree back because it was super duper salty. While it only took them maybe 5-10 minutes to re-do the dish, it was still a very disappointing experience. \\n\\nThere were some memorable plates! They were these; all four of the hors d\\'oeuvres (they were beautifully plated and oh-so-delish!), the bread they served on the side, pan seared foie gras (the BEST dish), and something creamy with corn (can\\'t remember the name).\\n\\n\\nBottom line for me?

Of all the courses, I probably had only 1 dish that I wasn't a huge fan of. Other than that, every course was delicious, amazing, and unforgettable.\\n\\nService: the service was impeccable. The staff makes sure to time each of your courses perfectly and even when I leave for the washroom, they replace my linen cloth.\\n\\nCreativity: Their food is not only delicious, but they really put a lot of thought into how to present each dish in a very playful and creative way.

Also, when I get up from my seat at a table I have a habit of loosing my napkin. I hang it on the chair and it falls. Here, I got up from the table a few times and when I came back there was a fresh napkin on the table waiting for me. Oh... And when some of the people at the table were cold they were offered a basket of pashminas. \\nFood: amazing. Some of us had food allergies like gluten, nuts, dairy and more. The restaurant did an amazing job accommodating. They even had gluten free chocolate covered pretzels. They were also able to whip some great dairy substitutes on demand using coconut,  soy and almond milk. The flavors were as unique as the presentation.\\nThey made a dish out of a sunflower. Who knew one could eat that or that the dish could be this interesting?\\nOther notables: there was a chocolate tasting game at the end of the meal that the child in me enjoyed a lot. \\nDinner can last as long as 5 hours and they give you breakfast to go. \\nThe place is pricey, but for a special occasion it is worth a try!\\n\",\n",

Nothing to talk about there.\\n\\nDinner is very interactive and lots of showmanship going on. First, we were given a small sealed envelope that we have to open up with a knife we were given. Inside there are two cards,one for me and one for the bf. We then need to pick between Apple, maple, cranberry and celery for the theme of each of our dinner. Hmmmm. We wondered how that would pan out. I picked celery and he picked Apple. More on that later. \\n\\nSo for show:\\n- celery root that was cooked in pigs bladder. So they come out to show you the pigs bladder with the celery root in it. Cooking process is explained and the chef will make the motion of basting it with whatever juice they cook it in. \\n- for entree, we were to choose between duck and another protein (I forgot). If you choose the duck, they\\'ll come out with the whole dry aged duck for show and again explain the cooking process\"before\" they cut you your piece. \\n- For dessert, they have the baked Alaska. Fire is made through lighting up rum and basting the dessert with the fired up rum. \\n- Even their cheese plate are assembled table side with the cart brought to you. Each cheese with which locale it came from and type explained. \\n\\nAll that hoopla is nice but it does take away from the taste of it. We came for the food, not the entertainment.

The theme running throughout was enhancing the taste with tartness (strawberry foie gras, pickles on the beef and duck, etc.). Sounds odd I know but that's why it's so amazing. \\n\\nImpeccable service as well.

Starting from the black and white cookies, to the end strawberry ice cream. Even their crisp bread with duck fat was remarkable! \\n\\nThe part which surprised me the most was absolutely the guessing chocolate part.

The service is likely among the best in the world.  \\n\\nSo, I go to restaurants for the food.  and on that score, the food was decidedly mediocre, at best.  the presentation - Flawless.  Creativity - Superb.  However on the single most important metric how I would judge a restaurant, which is Taste, it fell down in a big way.  It didn't taste like i was eating armpit fur or roadkill; far from that.  However for a $225 fix prixe meal, I have standards.  I want to be amazed.  I want to close my eyes and wonder how they accomplished that flavor profile.  I want to eat my dessert and shudder with pleasure and anticipation of the next bite.  I did none of those things.

My sister had called the restaurant and ordered a round of bubbles which will promptly served soon after we sat, with a congrats note to DF.\\n\\nOne of the many servers of our night came out to ask about allergies and discuss the concept of the chef's menu.  We all nodded, as I think we had all been so excited about this meal that we had all thoroughly read the website to prep.\\n\\nBy now, with the first buzz kicking in, I made the decision to go full-out and do the wine pairing with the meal.  Hey you only live once right? Right?\\n\\nAs you can imagine, this meal was definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience (price and sheer luxury, as other Yelpers have mentioned), but it was worth every penny!  In our time at EMP, we got 15 courses, wine with 10 of the courses (there was a point in the night when I had to ask our head waiter to please not top me off anymore, I was definitely starting to feel the buzzz when he was so generous with the extra pours!)\\n\\nHead waiter was a bit snooty as the evening started, but we quickly charmed him with our food and wine knowledge, wit, and west coast friendliness!  He was quickly our BFF.  Or perhaps we were just one of THOSE tables, the ones that think they are so witty and charming when honestly are (lets be honest) just plain drunkety drunk drunk! ;)\\n\\nI don't want to give anything away, but at the end of the night when we received our souvenir menu (along w/ a mason jar full of housemade granola to take for breakfast), it broke the courses down by dominant ingredient: cheddar, oyster, shrimp, sturgeon, foie gras, carrot, lobster, squash, duck, greensward, malt, apple, sweet potato, pretzel, chocolate. Phew! I definitely enjoyed some courses more than others, but every one made me pause and think due to the complexity and depth.  A gastronomical success of the highest order!\\n\\nThis restaurant is definitely worthy of being #5 on the list of Top Restaurants in the World (S.

As a wise Canadian philosopher once eloquently stated, YOLO, right? And am I glad we decided on that because without all of that booze, I probably would have been a lot more annoyed throughout the evening with the pretentiously absurd amount of food we were actually served.\\n\\nTasting menus should leave you feeling very satisfied and put you in a food coma; it shouldn\\'t make you feel so hammered-- well, actually, it should, but not to simply fill the void of the aforementioned food coma.\\n\\nThe two stars is for the excellent service and the wonderful libations. I give the food a solid \"meh\". As for the new no tipping policy, that is merely another pretentious ploy. They probably only implemented that to \\n\\n1) Make you feel less of a schmuck at the end so you can go spread the word to all your little friends\\n2) Ensure everybody pays a guaranteed service fee (no cheapos) through increasing the prices of everything else (gotcha)\\n\\nDon\\'t be fooled, my friends.

From a practical standpoint it was a good balance between high high ratings and attainability.\\n\\nThe food was obviously very good--tasting menu of I think 14 dishes all based on the best possible ingredients and cooked well. There's no attempt at creating a new flavor, no micro gastronomy. The dishes aren't intended to be shocking because they're hard to wrap your head around, they just taste better than anything a normal person could make using food that tastes naturally better than anything a normal person could find.\\n\\nThe other side of it was the dining experience itself. I think the restaurant gets into the upper reaches of the rankings because its pretty grandiose. It's not disgustingly obnoxious--there were probably only two lower level Russian oligarchs there--but it's worth noting that the restaurant gets such high praise not based on food alone.

Caviar was served with cute English muffins.  Celtuce was nicely cooked.\\nMain dishes: Lobster was perfectly poached; oh so soft, nearly melted in your mouth.  Roasted duck was sublime; amazingly seasoned crispy (but not too crispy) skin and perfectly tender moist meat.

Chocolate shell dessert was elegantly served and beautifully 'opened up' with hot bourbon caramel sauce.\\n\\nTheir selection of wines by the glass are very good, as expected.

Kinda expecting all the beautiful plates I've seen in the pics, but where were all those colorful flowers on the plate? Where?? My asparagus looked so lonely on the plate. \\n\\n2. Service might had an off day and I might be overly critical but hey, for a 3 star Michelin restaurant, who would blame me for nitpicking the details? So, first they mistakenly put someone else's carrot tartare grinder on my table, and then my carrot tartare was missing its salt condiment (Yes, look at the pic and one bowl was empty lol). Then when I was back from the restroom, somehow my napkin was gone and one server seeing me approaching my table, ran a bit but missed his chance to move the table out of my way (I didn't need that kind of small attention but I did feel sorry for him lol). Comparatively, Gordon ramsay restaurant in london with its world class service still trump on all service aspects over EMP. \\n\\n3. Some dishes had this overpowering taste that I was not too fond of. The morel custard was too acidic, the pretzel was too salty, and the lobster was slightly overcooked and the leaves on top was really really salty. \\n\\nBut here are some highlights. The seared foie gras was the best I've ever eaten in my life! The duck skin was heavenly, the meat was moist and tasty. The asparagus and potato black truffle puree was out of this world (although again, it looked a bit lonely). The carrot tartare, their unique interpretation of beef tartare, was so unique that I would choose this over a real beef tartare, anytime! Really, how could you manage to make carrot that delicious? Loved their interpretation of egg benedict too, super special.\\n\\nSo overall, out of  the 15 menu, there were 6-7 that I might go crazy about, but the rest were great, but not phenomenal.

The first dismissed aspect was that there was a party of two seated near the entrance in jeans, t-shirt and casual shoes. For a 3 Michellan star, their dress code standards are very low. Our party of 4 made the effort to suit up and dress up for a special occasion and experience. \\n\\nWhen we first arrived we were seated by a gentleman who he acknowledged us of our wedding anniversary, as a restaurant with the prestige of Eleven Madison Park the least I expected was a surprise dessert or even an acknowledgment of our anniversary at the end of the night, we got NOTHING. The level of service went down hill from there. \\n\\nThe level of service that we received was worse than a fast food chain, as you can feel from the waiters that they didn't want to be there. Some examples were when placing our knives and forks they were dropped onto the table, plates being removed on the table when the whole table has not finished their meal and numerous times waiters leaning over you to pick up your plate. After a hot summer day we were seated and served warm sparkling water, which was unpleasant. \\n\\nThese are situations you would not expect from the number 3 restaurant in the world. It's such a shame as the food was actually enjoyable. \\n\\nOn a brighter side the interaction of the menu was pleasing with the picnic, BBQ fruits and also the chocolate guessing game which took our minds off the service.\\n\\nAll in all it would be hard to recommend Eleven Madison Park to others as I do not want my friends to go through the unexpectedly bad service.\\n\\nFor the restaurant to be successful and to be known as one of the best restaurants in the world management needs to train their staff better and professional to all customers as there were a few tables who were non Asian beside us and you could notice the level of service was 100 times better. Maybe the removal of gratituity has dampened the service with unmotivated service.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Summary:  8 courses.  Creative and likely deserves it's Michelin stars, but not my favorite.  Good service, a bit loud. Try to get a table that is closer to the sides.  \\n\\nAtmosphere:  The location in the CSFB building looks like a redone gotham bank.  The super high ceilings mean sound bounces in a way that is not great.  I could hear everything that was said at the table next to mine, yet struggled a bit to hear my party near by.  In comparison, the other 3 star michelins are more quiet.  However, that also means EMP is more lively in feel than the others which are more quiet elegance.  The crowd, to me, looks more banker than foodie.  I mean, not even foodie banker, just banker.  A real shame.\\n\\nThe Service: In some ways, they are so extremely thoughtful I cannot possibly rate them low. In other ways, I think the other restaurants have them sorely beat, and this is despite the fact they got the Service award for the 50 Words Best restaurants list.  On the good side, you have extremely knowledgeable staff who can tell you everything about the menu and how it's prepared and I will forgive that the person we asked didn't know if the beef was grass fed. Staff watches attentively.  The gift bags at the end are extremely considerate and staff has clearly been told who is coming and is gracious.  \\nOn the bad...We were seated toward the middle, and I found myself having to track down a waitress.  Additionally - and potentially because there is a bit more of a buzz in the place - service is more noticeable.  Usually at the 3 star michelins, service is a bit like Mr. Deeds, you don't notice crumbs or their removal.  Here it was a bit more obvious.  \\n\\nThe Food:  The  menu changes 1x per quarter and I want to try it again.  There is a coherence to the use of ingredients which show up in multiple dishes to tie things together. The restaurant in Jan moved from 11 courses to 8.  I have heard that despite their reason - to improve the quality of each course - most feel this season's menu wasn't as good as those in the past.  Overall, this is where - sadly - I took off the star.  Also, overall.... way way too much salt, even I like salt. Also, there were some real misses, that I hope will never happen again for a 3 star Michelin.\\n  \\nBlack & White cookie - 3 stars. Total bust.  Savory in all the wrong ways.\\nOyster on top of Creme Fraise w/caviar - 5 stars. Amazingly perfect. \\nFava Bean croquette - 5 stars, second best bite\\nPeekytoe crab salad on dikon  - 5 stars, eat it like a taco.  Wonderful.\\nEggs Benedict with caviar and ham - 5 stars, best bite.  Extremely creative and compact. If they had stopped here, I would be in love.\\nSeared Fois Gras.  Salty and sour, which I liked but all else found it too salty.\\nFois Gras Terraine - 1 stars. Total pass. Salty with weird sweet. Just awkward.  Someone should have stopped the chef.\\nBean Appetizer - 5 stars. Looks the way it tastes, like spring.  Delightful, light and fresh 3rd best bite.\\nLobster - 4 stars.  Delightful flavor, well seasoned.  EXTREMELY difficult to cut.  Staff should have caught this and at a minimum served with a steak knife.  Odd that you would have this with lobster. Guys... you're too good not to have caught this. Also, a bit salty.\\nFluke - 5 stars.  The better choice for the course.  Delicious, light, modern american.\\nAsparagus with special preparation and a bit of mash potato. 4 stars.  Tied for best bite, but literally a bite.  a single piece of asparagus with sauce so good we used the bread to sop it up.\\nDuck - 4 stars.  The better choice for the main.  Great unique crust.  However, eat each part separately, as putting a bit of everything french style is not a cohesive taste.  The other stuff on the place doesn't go so much.\\nSteak with Eggplant - 3-4 stars.  Eh... it's fine.  Meaty, but not so notable.  \\nThe Bread - salty.  as is the cheese butter.  Together they are way way way too salty. Think salted butter with salty cheese topping in salty bread.  I think the problem is the chef sourced a very salty butter that then overwhelmed the flavor.\\nStrawberry's poached with elderflower - 3 stars.  essentially a decomposed strawberry shortcake. I like strawberry shortcake better.\\nBaked alaska - 5 stars. Solid execution.\\nBanana Bread Dessert - 4 stars.  My friends liked it.  I think it was a bit salty and also this one is better in parts than when you eat a bit with everything together.\\nChocolate game.  3 stars.  I like how creative the game is.  I hate that they made me eat goat and sheep chocolate... a taste I will never be able to get out of my mouth.  bad bad bad bad bad... can't we play guess the fruit in the chocolate instead???\\n\",\n",

We were not treated poorly or as though we were less important than any other diners, which was so refreshing and relaxing.\\n\\nSince it was the lunch hour, we were not looking to gorge ourselves, so we skipped over smaller dishes and just went for the trout and duck for ourselves. We were struggling with the decision to get bread and cheese, as it was camembert and I love camembert, but then they brought out complimentary bread and butter, so we were good with that. The bread was made in-house as was the butter and they were both so delicious, we had to restrain ourselves from eating them all at once, especially since he had been warned we had a 45-minute wait for the duck.\\n\\nWhen the entrees came out, we were surprised that they were a little small when the waiter had described them as \"entree-sized\" which must mean something different at a place that serves mostly tasting portions. However, they were both absolutely delicious. The trout was easily my favorite of the two. It was perhaps the smoothest texture I\\'ve ever encountered in a fish and was just so delicate and tasty. Then there was a sauce underneath a squash blossom (I think?) that was this wonderfully unexpected surprise of bright flavor that paired so well with the delicacy of the fish. I could\\'ve eaten that whole dish, but for the sake of trying everything, we switched halfway through.\\n\\nI thought the duck itself was delicious. However, the crust had coriander seeds and some other strong spice or herb and it kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the duck. We also seemed to have gotten a fat line or something as the duck had a very tough portion that we could not cut through easily. The crust was also very tough and difficult to fight through, both with knife and teeth. I think the flavor was great, but it was such a jarring texture, it made it the less enjoyable dish to me (I do not mean to imply it was bad, it was excellent, just a little less wonderful than the perfect pairing in the trout dish). Then again, the best part of the plate was the little surprise of a beet sauce and some sort of blossom on top.\\n\\nOverall an excellent meal, probably some of the cleanest flavors I\\'ve ever had. I would love to go back and try the tasting menu now.\\n',\n",
       " 'My two visits to Eleven Madison Park were within just shy of two years; the first still stands as one of the best dining experiences I\\'ve yet to have but my second... The menu was, no doubt, considerably different and perhaps my palate had become more critical over time as well. But it\\'s with a heavy heart that I have to revise my prior rating for EMP downwards.\\n\\nWhat had changed? The restaurant still holds its three Michelin stars, and in the time that had passed, had moved upwards on San Pellegrino\\'s list of \"The World\\'s 50 Best Restaurants\" to fourth place, surpassing evening Chicago\\'s esteemed Alinea. The high-ceilinged Art Deco building was just as majestic as I had remembered, although arriving in the evening gave it a subtler, less harsh appearance. The very server who had overseen my first meal back in March of 2013 was there to take care of us again this evening; he was able to even point to the very table I had sat in on my prior visit. No, it comes down to, at the very end, the food.\\n\\nThe beginning was the same, featuring the savory version of the Black and White Cookie with an apple filling, as well as instructions to choose one of four ingredients on a pop-out paper sheet (which later turned out to be a house-made flavored soda). It was followed by a familiar bread course, featuring the croissant-like rolls served with a lightly salted pat of butter, as well as a small cup of venison broth. The only other courses that were similar to the tasting menu I\\'d had years back were the final two: a chocolate covered pretzel with a sprinkling of sea salt, as well as the final ending bite, a sweet Black and White Cookie with an apple molasses filling.\\n\\nThere were courses that shone, of course. I fell for the Hudson Valley Foie Gras; it was seared in this iteration, and served with a blood sausage base, a dotting of cranberries, and entwined with a leaf of kale. The richness of the liver blended beautifully with the metallic tang of the blood sausage, and the textural contrast in each small bite was sublime. The quartet of Long Island Seafood was also memorable, featuring a gorgeous bite of Oyster with Yogurt and Lemon, a Scallop dotted with Pistachio and Apple, marinated Blue Crab with Pickled Radish, and a Vichyssoise with Caviar, Smoked Blue Fish, and Quail Egg. Our \"main course\", which took a beautiful cut of medium-rare venison, was thoughtfully composed with the accompanying braised beets and onions. The course that we found the most sublime, however, was perhaps also the simplest, one that paired a sphere of Celery Root braised with Black Truffle with a creamy celery root puree.\\n\\nThere were dishes that weren\\'t quite as successful. The play on the quintessential Pastrami on Rye couldn\\'t compare to the original \"Bagel and Lox\" I\\'d had almost two years back; while creative, the various sauces and presentations weren\\'t as refined and intertwined as their predecessor. The sauce paired with the Atlantic Striped Bass was too overwhelming for my taste, as the clams, squid, and various other shellfish that had been cooked down for it overpowered the main protein. The Charcuterie course, with plated several miscellaneous bites (cured meats, liver on toast, jams, and the like) across a wooden board seemed haphazard, and quickly strewn together. And while I appreciated their take on the Baked Alaska, I missed the elegance and simplicity in the desserts I\\'d received nearly two years ago.\\n\\nEleven Madison Park is still good, make no mistake. The service is still phenomenal, welcoming and thoughtful without being invasive, with each course and transition perfectly timed. The 9-foot windows and pristine terrazo floors are still magnificent, and one of the most beautiful restaurants I\\'ve yet to step foot into. In the two visits that I\\'ve made, however, the most recent one pales in comparison to the first in terms of quality and innovation of their 16 course menu. Perhaps I\\'ve also become jaded; the last two years in New York City have been a rapid primer on fine dining for me, and perhaps even my most recent visit to Alinea has thrown off my perspective [1]. Nonetheless, honesty is always the best policy (in my book, anyway), so I\\'ll stand by four stars for now.\\n\\n--\\n[1] For anyone curious: Alinea is worth the trip to Chicago. Go.\\n',\n",
       " \"Came for anniversary dinner and here is what we had:\\n\\nSavory black & white cookies - cheddar cheese cookies, salty and not sweet.\\nSnacks: cucumber & cream cheese on rye toast, chip & dip - goat cheese & melon + tomato & watermelon dip, cucumber with dip, melon with cured watermelon which was smoky and tasted like meat.\\nSeared Hudson valley foie gras with strawberries both fresh & smoked. An excellent dish with the strawberries bringing out the flavor of the foie gras.\\nPeeky toe crab salad with zucchini - good flavor,\\nCrab was fresh.\\nPicnic of ratatouille with trout roe, pickled mackerel, caviar, tomato champagne. The tomato champagne was interesting. \\nSunflower with tomato and petals. I've never eaten sunflower before so this was interesting.\\nCorn that was creamed & smoked and also steamed. This was a sweet dish that showed how corn is very versatile.\\nLobster boil also had shrimp, bell peppers stuffed with lobster, baby corn, potatoes, clams, sausage, and beans with bacon. This was not as messy as a real lobster oil but you get the flavors associated with a lobster boil.\\nDuck breast with daikon radish, cherry & onion. The duck breast was medium rare and tender. The cherry added a tart taste to the dish.\\nBeef ribeye with eggplant. At this point I was getting really full. The beef was cook perfectly medium rare.\\nCorn with garlic. Yet another use of corn that went well with the main courses.\\nHeirloom tomatoes were plump and juicy.\\nCamembert roll, plum purée, basil with creme fraiche. This was the palate cleanser before dessert. It was good and did the job.\\nGrilled plum with oat cream & ice cream. I'm not a big fan of oat ice cream. The plum was good though.\\nGrilled cantouloupe with lemon balm & cantouloupe swirl. I liked this better than the other dessert.\\n\\nService was great. They were very attentive to the fact that it was our anniversary and made it a special night. The menu is different from a few years ago.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Excellent service - despite our large party - and beautiful venue. Interesting and delicious appetizers - carrot pate was a delicious surprise. I was surprised and pleased at the attention - and memory - regarding allergies. The staff was polite in reminding guests of ingredients and remembering preferences. The filet was a bit undercooked for my tastes - and while I'm certain they would've taken it back, with our large party I chose not to. I did enjoy the portion I ate - flavorful and moist. The beets and beet chips were a delectable accompaniment. One of my colleagues enjoyed a unique and delightful vegetarian option.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Went here because the gentlemen in charge of their beverage program received his Master Sommelier designation on the movie Somm. The wine pairings were impeccable as expected and the food was exceptionally creative. One of the courses was an actual picnic basket with house crafted sodas, remarkable. Beautiful space, great service, great wine and great food. This place should have Michelin stars, oh wait it did at the time, 3 of them to be exact,\\n',\n",
       " 'As many other foodies. if given a chance to experience the #1 restaurant in the world. you do it!. that said I\\'ve been to other Awesome stared Michelin restaurants, and this one was just a disappointment. big expectations, absolutely no delivery. All name, food didn\\'t back it up!. \\nFirst of all please understand that at no point would I call this a \"bad\" restaurant, the food is fancy enough, showy enough, and what I do believe they excel in (the service) is good enough. but kept on feeling cheated almost, as in if I was experiencing a restaurant that got to the top, and just gave up. I would even doubt that the head chef was at the helm that night, there was so many letdowns.\\nTo the good, you are received like they know you, there is no checking a list or even waiting (at the start) if you arrive on time you will be seated right away and handed over to a very capable waitress, a drink specialist, and another team member whose entire job seemed to be to set up the table and sweep it up when done (though even that stopped after the 4th course -  of an 8 course dinner). the drinks that were recommended where just plain outstanding (wine and a cocktail) so the bartender knows his stuff!...the restaurant is big, huge for new York standards  actually and nicely decorated for the holidays...  and that\\'s where I\\'m going to have to stop the \"good\".\\nTo the not so good. granted we were there on the 20th of December, it was my Birthday and were celebrating our upcoming nuptials (all of which they remembered - and mentioned). after the redesign that they went through mid year I really thought they would have come up with a personal, awesome, romantic set up. nope. very few main tables (weird for a place that big) we were seated by some booths by the bar area, arms reach from the next two tables, and right by the entrance to the bathroom areas, it was very loud oh so loud, half the time you couldn\\'t really hear the waiter when she nicely tried to explain the dishes in front of us. the color, the booth, the set up. really made me think of a Vegas all you can eat joint. lighting could have made it a bit better, but they decided on this yellow tint bulbs, I guess to make the place more romantic?. well when you mess up the rest, the noise, and you are so close to the next table, that you might as well call it family style dinning. dimming the lights to a darkish yellow, is just frustrating, because it makes all of the food they present you with, look gray and very unappetizing. \\nTo the food. again, not bad. yet again, doubt the main head chef (and owner now I guess) was there, the food is minimalistic, which is to be expected when you go for an 8 course menu, definitely more leaning to French than American. that said if I was to call the main ingredient of the night, I would say it was SALT. they go heavy on the salt on everything. the bread rolls have salt (and sea salt to the side), every dish is Salt heavy, even the desert (ice cream) had sea salt sprinkled over it. now I got absolutely nothing against salt. if anything my fiancé is the one that was suffering because she does hate salt heavy dishes, but this was extreme and completely unbalanced, there was nothing in the plate to run to in order to tune it down. no acid, no butter sauce. just salty stuff packed over salty stuff. there were some dishes that reminded me that we were at a fancy restaurant (like the duck - I thought it was good enough for a great French spot - absolutely not good enough for Michelin). but then there were others that just left me feeling cheated. a mushroom dish that was nothing that a huge mushroom on the dish with some type of sauce. again I LOVE Mushrooms. but when you see a dish consisting of just one thing, you expected to blow your mind. nope. together with the lighting (which made it look like a weird brown blob on the dish, it tasted like nothing. really nothing. no explosion of flavor. no awesome taste of mushroom. just tasted like a mushroom soaked in beef stock (not even, maybe vegie stock). the initial offering of caviar and an assortment of little jars of jellies. was just that. tasted like canned stuff.again not bad. but THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD!! I don\\'t expect to taste canned food!. caviar was good. but so tamed that all I tasted was the cream cheese under it actually... then came a pate dish. that was just one big slice of pate. I guess we were expected to eat it with the salty rolls, but since they came at different times and there was no good explanation of the dish left me to try the pate on its own. big mistake!. flavorless!. it tasked like eating butter. but not good butter. again, I like pate and love French food. this was neither.  The duck dish was ok, but there was barely any on the plate, same with the veal. barely any there and what was there was flavorless paired with a Salty sauce.\\nAt the end for $700+... for a dinner for two... this was not close to worth it. $50 a plate I would be closer\\n',\n",
       " \"Not much to say that hasn't been said from the other reviews. It's easy to see why it was so high on Pellegrinos list this year . Food was excellent, service impeccable and such a memorable parting gift of homemade granola. In comparison to some of the other 3 stars EMP definitely is more similar to french laundry vs Alinea... nothing mind blowingly crazy or surprising but very solidly executed french techniques and preparations. The caviar eggs Benedict were the highlight! Can't wait to come back another time\\n\",\n",
       " 'Not what I expected. Then again, I have very high expectations. Del Posto, Colicchio & Sons, and even Soigne in Brooklyn have much better food and service. The dining room is very dated, the background music was just horrible, staff was attentive but as it got busier they were less friendly, and the banister was broken. Yes, it was.... Both sides. For a 3 Michelin Star restaurant you would think that the details matter to them.\\n\\nAlso, what happened to the rest of the Baked Alaska????? A whole Baked Alaska is brought out, displayed, fired up, and they bring back 2 spoonfuls? What is up with that? Does anyone know where the rest of the Baked Alaska is? The couple next to us had it as well, and the rest of their Baked Alaska went missing, too. I would have preferred to take that home in an insulated bag instead of the dated granola. My boss went 10 years ago and also got the granola....smh.\\n\\nVery disappointing. Will never go back.\\n',\n",
       " \"I realize that rating EMP 4 stars seems ridiculous based on my rating of Dumpling Kingdom at 5 stars, but one of the issues with being rated the best restaurant in the US is high expectations and I think being so excited for the month leading up to dinner made it all feel a little anticlimactic. The night was a surprise for my boyfriend and since he didn't have time for research he loved our experience overall. \\n\\nWe were treated by name the moment we walked through the door which was pretty amazing especially because we arrived early to have a drink at the bar. We both got cocktails which were...fine. They both had the same issue I have with a lot of cocktails in NYC which is just a strange sense of balance. We didn't finish them because, for two people who love drinking, neither of us were over the moon about them. \\n\\nWe choose to do the wine pairing of unknown or small vineyards and it was by far the highlight of the meal. I've had wine pairings before but they never seemed to take much more into account beyond being red or white, dry or sweet. The sommelier was incredible and each wine really elevated our individual dishes in into something beyond what was on our plates. \\n\\nThe service seemed a little slow at times and the couple next to us was complaining about every part of their meal the entire time which seemed a little unnecessary. There was also a small child a few tables over who was watching a movie on an iPad and playing video games throughout the meal without headphones so it was less intimate than I had hoped and felt more like being at a casual dining restaurant. It would have been nice if they moved that family to a table that was not in the middle of the room so it didn't disturb the rest of us. I appreciate that they can drop that kind of cash on a meal for their kid, but it was special for us. \\n\\nThe small touches at the end of the meal were also highlights for me. The menus were custom printed based on our individual course choices and the wines we had with each. They came in little leaf printed tins that the caviar was served in earlier in the meal. They bring over a bottle of Apple brandy at the end and leave it on the table for you to help yourselves. The granola is phenomenal. The special birthday treat was great. \\n\\nGiven the choices we have in this city I'm not really sure if I would come back here if I was paying. There were some spectacular parts and I'm glad we did it once- definitely worth it!\\n\",\n",
       " 'Gorgeous creations. Delightful appetizers. Gracious servers. Well blended bib lettuce salad. Very exotic blend in egg quinoa kale dish. Perfectly done fish. Lovely place.\\n',\n",
       " \"Summary: Amazing experience. Great food and service. Presentation is exquisite and atmosphere is elegance without stuffiness. The walk-in al a carte dinner via the bar is an excellent bargain for the quality that this establishment provides. 3 well earned Michelin stars and no tips accepted. Hope to come back again. Recommend the Grog for a cocktail and mushroom or foie gras.\\n\\nMy wife and I wanted to hit up a Michelin start restaurant on our recent visit to the city, but we didn't want to deal with a 8+ course menu or with reservations two months in advance. I stumbled upon this Thrillist and discovered the walk-in option for Eleven Madison Park (article https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/michelin-star-restaurants-in-nyc-cheapest-new-york-options). It seemed like the perfect venue for what we were looking for.\\n\\nWe arrived around 5pm and waited for the doors to open a little before 5:30pm. The staff was still going through the pre-meal planning session as we checked our coats and bag, then made our way into the bar to a nice table near the top of the ramp. Soon we were greeted and given drink menus to peruse. I asked our server for recommendations of red wines based on my tastes and my wife did the same for cocktails. Soon my wife was delivered a glass of the Grog and I was presented with the Cab Franc to try.  Both were amazing, with my wife nearly downing the Grog in 10 minutes because it was so perfectly crafted (it even had a metal straw so that the liquid was cool the entire way). Following that she tried the English Milk Punch was surprisingly good for a whiskey drink (not my wife's typical choice) and had a massive cube-shaped ice cube with the four icon logo for the restaurant engraved into the top of it. Crazy cool!\\n\\nSoon it was time to order some food. Complimentary with the meal were a bowl of mixed nuts, a bowl of green olives, and a bowl of house-made potato chips. There was something so simple, but perfect about the three items that made them a great starter for the rest of the meal. We also received some flaky rolls with butter that had ground cheddar on top and a side of sea salt. Those had a nice texture, but could have been a little warmer. Here are the other items that we ordered:\\n\\nFoie Gras - Amazing. Very rich and creamy, but with a nice crust on the outside, balanced by the maple and apple roll served on the side. Such complex flavors and textures...wow.\\n\\nMushroom - Amazing. Earthy and soulful with delicious red quinoa and mushrooms. Again, the craftsmanship was incredible.\\n\\nLobster - They kindly split the dish into two plates so we could each have our own and it was delicious. The lobster was incredibly tender and flavorful with the bisque and other elements set before us.\\n\\nMalt - We got this because it sounded like a chocolate cheesecake, but it was not at all what we expected, unfortunately. The cheese was very powerful, the dish was more savory than sweet, and the maltiness was really intense. Fortunately, our server was empathetic and suggested we swap it out for...\\n\\nChocolate orange ganache - Much more traditional and sweet. My wife and I enjoyed it much better along with a glass of dessert wine. A great way to finish the meal.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the prices are high and the portions small, but 1) with the starters and sides we were definitely NOT hungry by the end of the meal, 2) the food is awesome, 3) the experience is wonderful. Our total came out to $260 (with built-in service charge, since they don't accept gratuity) and was worth every penny. We would go again in a heartbeat.\\n\",\n",
       " 'There is nothing I can that hasn\\' t already been said or that could even do justice to this amazing restaurant. We called three days in a row at exactly 9am to be kept on hold for 45 minutes each time to finally get a reservation at 5:45 on a Tuesday. I would have been kept on hold a week though. \\n\\nFrom the moment you walk in, you feel like royalty. Like you were meant to be there and that every wish or desire you have would be fulfilled by there team. As you enter into the rotating doors, past the iconic EMP sign, you are greeted by the Matrie\\'D and several attendants. They greeted us and asked politely for our names while helping take our coats. As soon as we said our names, it was followed by \"Oh yes, Mr & Mrs, please follow us this way\". \\n\\nWe sat in a lovely corner booth and had the iconic envelope, opener and black & white cookies awaiting us. As we sat, within a few minutes my husband needed to use the restroom and while he began excusing himself, attendants came over to move the table so that he did not have to awkwardly scoot out of the booth. They did this the entire night when we needed to get up. Service was absolutely spot on. Drank 25% of your water, well then it was time to refill it. Engulfed your delish bread and venison butter - why not get you more? It was amazing. \\n\\nThe food was just astonishing. Nothing was a \\'miss\\'. Everything was seasoned perfectly, well thought out, presented with style and tasted deep in flavor. I had several overall favorites. First, I loved the long island seafood course- four small plates of local seafood - oyster, crab, scallops and caviar. My favorite was the oyster and the scallop- served with pistachio. \\n\\nMy overall favorite course of the night was the celery root, braised in the pigs bladder. This is brought out to your table and basted tableside with vegetable stock. As the bladder increased in temperature, it expands and holds in the heat and braises the celery root - which is done with black (winter) truffles. It was absolutely amazing. The celery root was perfectly shaped, and still had some bite of texture whilst losing the fiberousness of the vegetable. The stock sauce with truffles complemented it so perfectly. \\n\\nAll the dishes were presented well, explained and had wonderful plating, presentation and flavor. From the baked Alaska to the slow cooked bass - all were divine. My last favorite was the wonderful assortment of cheese, served with house pretzel bread, small salads and quince. I fell in love with the simplicity and complexity of this. I love cheese courses, but they were able to pair cheeses to have individuality whilst going together- three types of each goats, cows and sheeps milk cheeses. All similar yet unique. After a very disappointing night at Momofuku Ko, this evening was absolutely perfect and shows how Daniel Humm and his team are so well renowned!!\\n',\n",

This is just one example I'm sure of their multiple service awards. \\n4 stars for food.

       " 'Chefs Table used to be located in Brooklyn for seven years until the relocation in December 2016 to the Hells Kitchen district in midtown Manhattan Inside this nondescript supermarket there is a worldclass restaurant The restaurant itself isnt large with a L shaped stainlesssteel counter as a centerpiece The ambiance is modern and minimal where everything serves a purpose  Shortly after seating Chef Ramirez emerged from the kitchen and greeted every table Welcome Good Evening He definitely errs more on the serious side but still friendly A man of little words but his dishes speak volumes Regarding the no photo rule they lessened the rigidity of this concept and you can take photos sitting at the table but not at the counter Discretely I was told This was happy news for me as I could not imagine not having memories of one of the best meals of my life  The tasting menu started off on a strong note with an amazing bluefin tuna tart We were advised to eat this in one bite asap before the pastry goes soggy The fatty tuna shined like jewels Seasoned simply with ginger and yuzu the flavours were clean and elegant It also had incredible visual appeal almost resembling a flower  Upon tasting the next amuse bouche it was a unanimous decision among my family that this is the most memorable dish of the night Fresh Hokkaido sea urchin roe on top of brioche topped with a slice of perigord truffle Even under the dim lighting the dish dazzled me with its enticing glossy shine The sea urchin was sublime even more plump than the ones I remember from my Hokkaido trip One bite and I was flooded with a sweet creaminess similar to custard and a slight crunch from the toasted brioche  Time for a seafood break I really enjoyed this next dish as it reminds me of a comfort food my mom used to make when I was younger Known as chawanmushi this is essentially a steamed savoury egg custard However chef Ramirez used corn purée instead of eggs On top charred corn kernels contrasted the silky smooth custard Finished off with pieces of creamy foie gras and a savoury dashi layer this further accentuated the sweetness of the dish  Sawara Spanish mackerel tasted intense with and a meaty texture The outer layer is carefully smoked as mackerels oils tend to absorb smoke better than leaner fish The crispy kelp added some texture to the mackerel Underneath is a small pool of rice vinegar which accented the mackerels robust flavour  This was one of my favourites one of the evening akamutsu red sea perch from Chiba The flesh was rich and easily flaked apart The oils from the akamutsu seeped into the Koshikihari rice underneath There were also bits of sea urchin in the rice  Next dish was another favourite of mine Wild sea bass from Holland was cooked sousvide resulting in an extraordinarily tender piece of fish A generous spoonful of Kaluga caviar accompanied the bass These glistening black pearls were nutty with a buttery mouthfeel To my surprise it wasnt overly salty like I expected with an undertone of smokiness The savoury sabayon was creamy balanced off with a mysterious tartness I couldnt identify  Abalone from Monterey Bay surprised me This mollusk is not commonly used in Western kitchens but its a highly prized ingredient in Asia It doesnt have a particular taste but its unique texture is comparable to a cross between mushroom and calamari The earthy almost chocolate aroma of the shaved black truffle was intoxicating I really liked the jus which tasted strongly of caramelized onions and a sweet wine ie madera or sherry This is a successful East meets West fusion creation  The one meat course was a show stopper A5 Miyazaki Wagyu Unlike regular beef which comprises of mostly saturated fat wagyu contains oleic acid an unsaturated fat responsible for the umami flavour of wagyu The incredible snowflake marbling was mesmerizing to look at Cooked to a perfect medium this melted like butter The velvety texture lingered on my palate ever so slightly With a protein like this the red pepper relish wasnt necessary  Frozen vanilla soufflé is often raved by everyone It was fluffy and airy which wasnt surprising as it incorporated liquid nitrogen The coolness made the soufflé more appealing to eat in the hot summer month Underneath there were white chocolate balls which added a pleasant crunch  Even though Chefs Table is a steep expense on the wallet its evident that Chef Ramirez spares no cost in sourcing the best worldclass ingredients for his customers The majority of his seafood comes fresh from Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo flown in daily Other restaurants would definitely charge an extra charge for luxury items like black truffle caviar bluefin tuna etc One of the best meals Ive ever had and I dont say that lightly ',\n",
       " 'Finally got to see what the hype was about  Overall was an interesting experience with a number of very good dishes  Also pretty different from the other Michelin three stars in the city maybe with a little bit more Brooklyn edginess vs typical old world charm  Restaurant is small but actually not a very intimate vibe  Service is generally attentive but not as stuffy as some of the other three stars  I will say there was a small fly buzzing around for a while even which was seen and commented on by multiple diners a bit surprising to me for a restaurant at this price point  The meal starts off more lightJapanese and ends more heavyFrench is how the waiter explained  Style of the food is all seafood ex two meat courses  When I say all seafood I mean mostly fish after fish after fish with very little veggies to be honest I think the only green leaf I ate was some tiny garnish on one of the dishes    But you will get an umami explosion of a meal which you wont get from any other western resto in NYC as far as I know lmk if you know otherwise very dramatic contrast with the European style seafood restaurants in the city like Le Bernardin or Marea  The dishes also seem more simply prepared in keeping with the Japanese influence  Onto the food  Really amazing  1 Frozen soufflé was for me best of the night  without too many spoilers everything went so well together from the beautiful plate it came in to the  taste of the powder they sprinkle on the bits of surprising finds at the bottom of the dish even the name which is a clever misdirection because its not really a real soufflé for me this was a Michelin three star quality dish not just executed well but creatively designed and delightful to eat  Very very good dishes 2 Baby red snapper with squid ink rice  the flavor complexity of this dish was impressive 3 Akamutsu with chanterelles  again extremely umami dish with a delicious broth 4 Duck with prosciutto and berries  I demand to only eat duck if it comes with prosciutto from now on seriously I dont know why other restaurants dont do this 5 Kaffir lime sorbet  very good minty follow up to the richness of the wagyu 6 Shima aji amuse bouche  in tiny tart form very umami but light and intriguing first course to pique your interest  Also very good 7 Uni bread with black truffle  fluffiness of the bread went very well with the uni 8 Wagyu beef coin  very fatty marbling   9 Beluga caviar in the sea bass course  very good on its own  these are only in this section because they are a bit similar to how other high end restaurants work these ingredients  Still great execution but less creative for me  Did not work for me 9a Sea bass next to the beluga caviar  was a little bit tough 10 Langoustine  a bit rubbery did not enjoy  I think langoustine should be treated like shrimp or lobster  if it will turn out anything but soft and melt in your mouth probably best to not include at all  Also it came with a piece of cheese on top that may have made it more chewy than it had to be while the taste didnt quite go along 11 Turbot  I was not a fan of the heavy sauce that came with it which felt overwhelming to me and did not go with the fish  The remaining two courses crab  which looked pretty and caramel milk ice cream were not bad but also not extremely memorable  Overall  despite some unevenness with a few dishes I didnt like the bright spots were very good and it does seem like they take risks Worth a visit especially if you prefer an umami palate ',\n",

       " 'We celebrated our 20th anniversary here an annual tradition we started years ago to visit a top Michelinstarred restaurant in NYC In a word this is by far the worst one we ate in and weve visited them all  The highlight is its location Certainly an unexpected surprise to find its entrance at the back of a food market Its nicely decorated although most of the place is taken up by a huge bar rather than intimate tables The waiter was polite but for sure forced each smile which he couldnt wait to wipe off his face It was so disingenuous it was impossible not to notice He rushed to describe the dishes as if he was speed reading Next to our table the speaker blasted 70s rock music with a very poor choiced playlist that was waaay to loud    The food we ordered a tasting menu was  beautifully presented but the taste was nothing to write home about Out of 11 or so dishes we were blown away by 2 the others were bland bitter or just odd In all honesty we tasted much better following a YouTube recipe cooking at home   Its customary that at the end of the meal you get some token from the restaurant a small bag with candy a menu with a note just a nice touch to remember them by  Here we got a sealed envelope with a menu of what we ordered However the page was a sloppy mess with no care nor any attetion behind it  Just 1 word descriptions not even centered on the page and no reference nor wishes of a happy anniversary nor a thank you for visiting Very cheaply done   I think this restaurant is a case of the emperor with no clothes on Because you pay 800 for 2 for a tasting menu youre almost embarrassed to say it sucked But it did Do they even know who they are competing against If youre going to spend the money go to Eleven Madison Daniel or Per Se Putting this pretentious mess in tbe same category as those places is like comparing McDonalds to JeanGeorges   Michelin star my butt ',\n",

       " 'Do you visit a Michelin 3Star restaurant ONLY for the food or the ENTIRE experience If its the latter then Chefs Table Brooklyn Fare is the biggest horseshit in the world  So we thought we have completed visiting every 3Michelin Star restaurant in Manhattan  Found out Chefs Table moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan of course we were compelled to visit  Saturday 730pm table for four  Before I begin let me stress this review is no way directed to ANY server or personnel at Chefs Table  Each and every one of them is personable professional courteous and the establishment is lucky to have them all  The concept of Chefs Table is that this restaurant takes away all the traditional fanfare of an upscale restaurant experience to simply gather around chefs kitchen and seetaste his creations  Im all for that except this experience is not really that  Somehow I have a very different interpretation of communal and after visiting the six other 3MichelinStar restaurants yes I am still counting Daniel I have certain expectations  Lets start with dress code  The restaurant REQUIRED that formal business attire be the dress code  Let me paint this picture for you you are in your formal business attire on a Saturday evening perusing through a convenience store squeezing yourself next to local tenants shopping in their tanktop and shorts  Do I feel elegant no I look and feel like a schmuck  The restaurant is located in the back of Mantena buildings convenience store  Call it Brooklyn Fare grocery store wine cellar whatever you want  its in the back of a convenience store  I first thought the speakeasy type of entrance may be interesting  Its not  Its not because once you entered the restaurant you realize it was probably once the stockroom for the convenience store  Not much was converted making the transition the ceiling was low the décor was average so you end up feeling exactly how someone would feel in his formal business attire walking into the stockroom in the back of a convenience store  Everyone was eager to help  We were seated at undoubtedly the best table in the place slightly elevated but not at the counter  Heres the problem we cant see the chef or what hes doing  I dont know if I want to be seated on the counter  The place was uncomfortably warm and I can only imagine how even more uncomfortably hot it will be on the counter  How do you not accommodate for the temperature in the room  The place is loud with what sounded like Q104 on the speakers  Tell me again why am I dressed up in formal business attire to be here  No real intro or narration as we were poured champagne to start the evening and the first course was upon us  Absolutely loved the tuna  Sea urchin was a bit fishy since its simply fresh but the generous portion of caviar quickly made up for this  And when I say generous it was probably three times the amount in other places  Thank you Chef  Langoustine was maddeningly delicious along with the crab meats and the three proceeding fish dishes were the absolute best I have ever tasted  The dessert dishes were quite plain  I was the only one at the table not with wine pairing  I had a glass of champagne and a glass of rosé  Again Im not a big wine drinker  Wine somehow doesnt enhance the flavor of food for me  I actually prefer water with a meal as such  My other three guests all enjoyed the wine paired with each dish  My brother did commented that he expected more portions and selection from the pairing option  One of our guests had to use the bathroom  She was taken outside the restaurant to a locked room adjacent to the reception desk where she unlocked the door for her to use  I did the same and exited with another guest standing in the middle of the grocery store waiting to use the bathroom  Is this really Michelin3 standard  I feel like Im at a gas station waiting to use the bathroom  Hey I got an idea if you need space the Shell gas station on Westside Highway has space in its parking lot for you to convert it into a larger bathroom  How about having a Bentley outside Mantena to shuttle everyone to and from this bathroom in a real 3Michelin Star style  Chef César Ramirez is obviously a master in his craft  I loved every dish  He obviously can afford to upgrade EVERYTHING other than his cooking for the experience to be complete  He simply chooses not to  This experience unfortunately just wasnt what I considered elegant special or any other metaphor you can think of to fully describe fine dining especially when the ingredients in our menu can be easily purchased by anyone at this convenience store  2600 for four before tip wasnt too outrageous but bottom line is that if someone I cared about whether they are my friends or family ask me which 3MichelinStar restaurant in Manhattan would you recommend  It is without a doubt NOT Chefs Table ',\n",

       " 'KenScale 9010  Out of all the top restaurants in New York Ive had the highest level of frustration booking a table at Chefs Table at Brooklyn Fare In its previous location in Brooklyn the restaurant only accepted reservations via phone and the line opens up at 10 am every Monday for any spot in a given day 7 weeks out Whenever I called the line was busy and by the time I got connected to the reservation line around say noon all the tables were taken I was giving up on trying my luck at the restaurant until I heard recently that the restaurant moved to the Brooklyn Fare location in Manhattans Midtown West neighborhood and a friend of mine who is a regular at the market was able to connect with a person who is in charge with taking care of reservations To my shock I had no problem getting a spot around 3 weeks out during prime time on a Friday evening and was super excited to finally see what chef Cèsar Ramirez has been up to at his kitchen The verdict chef Ramirezs tasting menu now up at 330 per person certainly didnt disappoint and it should be one of the best fine dining destinations in the city   The seafoodcentric tasting menu at Chefs Table leans toward Japanese and I really loved the consistent level of clean flavor and emphasis on textural delight of each dish I could tell that the kitchen is very meticulous when it comes to sourcing different seafood ingredients in various bitesized starters that were rolled out whether thats the pile of trout roe in the tartlet form sea urchin from Hokkaido with a sheet of black truffle on top or the white yellowtail accompanied by ginger and sunchoke pepper Sea urchin was one of the freshest Ive had in a while and I still cant figure out what kind of magic the kitchen put together for the yellow tail with astounding level of balance in flavor and texture Caviar that came on top of kabocha squash was pure bliss as well and Norwegian king crab accompanied by apple and shiso was not only beautiful looking with flower petals on top but so memorably delicious with complexity of flavor as well Im not sure if I have had a grilled lobster as crunchy as the one that Ive had at the Chefs Table in recent years and the koshihikari rice submerged below black truffle displayed a ton of richness without somehow making me tired of it and I indulged in every scoop of this marvelous dish Compared to all the brilliant seafood dishes the lone meat dish Miyazaki wagyu somewhat paled in comparison The meat was expertly cooked to more or less perfect medium rare but I kept wondering if the meat wouldve been better served with the sauce underneath that was rather strong in flavor Following a refreshing scoop of grapefruit sorbet came a couple of outstanding dessert dishes Soba chai ice cream with soy caramel had the nice hint of Japanese flavor and my girlfriend and I couldnt stop raving about the frozen almond soufflé that was so wonderfully delicate that we had no problem finishing our share even though we were beyond stuffed by this time Toward the end of the meal chef Ramirez stopped by to check if everything was OK he occasionally served dishes right in front of guests such as the caviar and graciously agreed to take photos with us There has been some rumblings about chef Ramirezs demeanor in the press a couple of years ago but I couldnt sense any of that in our brief interaction with him  I suspect the relative ease with which I was able to snag a spot was Chefs Table has to do with the fact that the Manhattan location now has tables outside of the kitchen counter that can serve additional diners Guests who dine at 6 or 9 pm slots are expected to be seated at the counter while those who dine in between like us when we booked a spot at 730 pm will be eating at the surrounding tables so if you want to have a counter tasting experience make sure to book the time slots There is a vast wine selection many from France from which you can select to complement your awesome meal I cant compare the atmosphere of the Manhattan location to that in Brooklyn since Ive been to the previous one before but overall it was civilized vibe without the fuss of fine dining Im so glad that Chefs Table made a move to Manhattan conversely it marks the end of an era where Brooklyn used to have at least one threeMichelin star dining establishment and would love to see how the food here evolves over time The overall dining experience at Chefs Table certainly puts it at the top echelon of all the wonderful culinary spaces in the city ',\n",

       " 'Up to date I have been to Chefs Table 8 times already I have read a lot of comments so far It seems pretty interesting that people either hate it to death or love it like crazy There is rarely in between reviews I believe the main reason may be the nature of its very special concept  Ingredients  I am totally a sushi lover So of course Chefs Table using fish uni wagyu and etc imported directly from Japan won my heart in the first place Additionally about the choice of ingredients the chef has an eye of toptier Japanese sushi chefs  Here is the proof Chefs table provides pretty much the toptier kinds of seasonal fish that we can import to US with very high and consistent quality such as managatsuo butterfish kinmedai golden eye snapper akamutsunodoguro black throat sea perch kasugodai baby snapper saba Japanese mackerel and also Hokkaido Bafun Uni Besides their permanent dish includes Miyazaki A5 wagyu steak which is also the top level steak from Japan  Cooking  If you know Japanese food very well and you like Japanese food youd probably love Chefs Table I saw people speaking ill of their nearly rare fish dishes Here is the thing if you do not typically eat rare fish or sushi this restaurant is not your type The chef incorporated a lot of Japanese concepts in his cooking including one of my favorite tricks which is using charcoal to sear the fish skin Sushi fish in high quality shall have high percentage of fat So the heat from the charcoal can melt some fat and make the fish more flavorful and oily The smoky scent from the charcoal also adds up At the same time the major part of the fish will not be cooked too much and is able to maintain portion of its fat and soft texture Besides fish the chef also knows well how to cook meat Ive had wagyu lamb and pigeon during the past Wagyu is always cooked perfectly at relatively low temperature which is best for fatty steak like wagyu Considering all the wagyu I had at Chefs Table I couldnt say lamb and pigeon can give the restaurant extra stars but they were still very impressive compared to most the tasting menus I have tried over the years  As many people may know their truffle uni brioche is one of the major reasons that keep people returning to the restaurant So I will not once again say too much about that Most recently I had the chance to try another truffle uni course the winter dish  white truffle uni risotto It was amazing Actually such dish is very famous in Japan Japanese people love the pasta or risotto to be cooked with sweet bafun uni and covered by a thick layer of shaved white truffle Now I found a pretty good one in US Maybe because I used to go to Chefs Table in early spring and late summer at the very beginning I did not even know this dish was on the menu in every white truffle season  For me this is my favorite restaurant in NY but not necessarily to be yours After all I think eating is a very personal thing No matter how a restaurant is doing there are always patrons who are addicted to it and for sure some people who cannot love it or even just hate it ',\n",
       " 'Finding the restaurant is not so simple It is at the back of the Brooklyn Fare Grocery store in the middle of a desolate block   The restaurant inquired to see if we were celebrating a special occasion which we disclosed but the restaurant never acknowledge them so I am not sure why they bothered to ask  The restaurant has changed some of their ridiculous policies which is a good thing We were initially told that we could not make a reservation for three because the restaurant only accommodated even numbered parties We could have a single person join us if were only three people Really at 330 per person we are going to have some random person join our celebratory family dinner It is preposterous that that a single parent was unable to dine with their two adult children The restaurant shortly after my initial inquiry changed its policy although the website still says that seatings are offered for two or four  The photograph policy also appears to have changed since the restaurant told me there were no issues taking photographs   Odd rumors that the chef hates on Asians seems bizarre since half the clientele was Asian some of the servers are Asian and the food has an Asian slant   The chef is present in the kitchen and greets all the diners which is really nice since so many starred chefs are awol He warmly greeted us and all the diners throughout the meal He even served the caviar course  The restaurants acoustics are impressive especially in the alcoved tables It was wonderful to dine and actually be able to hear the conversation Other restaurants should take note   But there were issues The meal was slow to start We didnt receive anything to eat until we sat there for about 20minutes We finally asked if they had forgotten us and at another point asked if the pace could be pickedup since we were hungry   We never received a menu nor were we given any choice about anything we ate A menu is not available online We were solely asked if we had any allergies or food issues But we had no idea how many courses there were what we would be eating nor what we ate after we were orally told what was on our plate It was odd Its impressive that some clients can remember what they accurately ate without tape recording the server I like a menu to help me pace myself and to follow along and at a minimum after the meal The food was delicious and the ingredients unusual which made not having a menu even more frustrating since there were so many unfamiliar elements   As tasty as each course was the three of us were unimpressed  For a meal that costs 330pp not including taxes but excluding service there was no wow factor like I have experienced at other comparable restaurants such as  Blue Hill at Stone Barns Eleven Madison Fat Duck or Alinea Something was missing from the evening Frankly Olmsted in Brooklyn was more impressive for a fraction of the price Most of the dishes relied too heavily on the unusual or expensive ingredient rather than being impressive on their own   The frozen soufflé was the one unusual dish whose tastes changed as the dessert melted but its appearance was rather blah looking   The predominance of the meal was fish and seafood with only one course of Wagu beef The warm potato bread that accompanied the meat was incredible and tasted like a latke We asked for a second roll The server hesitated since the rolls were made for the exact number of diners She brought one additional roll to the table We didnt realize that we each needed to request an additional roll so we shared it like paupers  The presentation of two petite fours signaled the meal was done and I mean finished The meal abruptly ended since the bill is prepaid so a check isnt proffered unless beverages are ordered a menu isnt presented and there is no parting takeaway gift We were suddenly dismissed and felt like we should immediately leave so we did Prior to our departure we were told that the restaurant offered a new service that enabled guests to make a return reservation if they made it prior to exiting Tacky doesnt even begin to describe how this sounded to us and we have no desire to return for a meal that was less than exciting at this price ',\n",

       " 'This has been a long time coming   My wife and I live close enough that Brooklyn Fare is our local grocery store Ive literally been in the adjacent space hundreds and hundreds of times but the Chefs Table was always a bit out of reach   The folks we sat next to mentioned that this was their ninth visit to the only Brooklyn restaurant to receive Michelins highest honor while I continue to hope that well one day magically find ourselves in their tax bracket in the real world for people like us this extravagant meal can only be attempted on a special occasion Hell the bottle of wine we got which was on the very very low end of their impressive list cost us as much as dinner would at most of our regular spots   But recently the stars aligned My wife was celebrating an important birthday and we were able to score a reservation So we went   Please keep in mind that Chef Ramirez doesnt allow photography or notetaking Although Im of the opinion that for this amount of money I should be allowed to rub the sous chefs head for good luck if thats what I want to do I am nothing if not obedient I do think my quick nonflash photography would be far less intrusive than the loud crapulent what an amazing word ladies across the waybut Im hanging out in my glass house over here so Ill keep my mouth shut In any case youre stuck with my incomplete wineaddled memory But what I do remember was remarkable   For starters the service was perfection Both the cooks and the servers move like in concert like welloiled machines with very few wasted motions They cook and plate and garnish and serve and clear all with a practiced efficiency that adds up to fairly perfect pacing The rubber doilies that are placed between each soiled dish are emblematic of the service as a whole everything is intelligently conceived to ensure that we the diners have the best possible experience You never hear the clank of a plate And the plates themselves In one presentation powerful magnets keep a small bowl of caviar upright on an angled stand A bite of mackerel was served atop a porcelain pedestal The stemware is the finest youll ever use and it all almost makes you feel like the money you spent is on display  Of course the food The food With over twenty I cant recall each individual course I happily lost count as I enjoyed the sheer variety and quality of the bites and of course the company of my middleaged wife But nearly all were memorable   The foie gras served in a dashi with ramp custard rivaled the sea urchin accompanied by a generous slice of black truffle for the best bite of the eveningbut there were many that were not far behind The black cod was buttery the turbot elegant the sea perch shockingly tender The gorgeous duck was a revelation with morels and an onion cream and the wagyu was actual wagyu not the gristley bits your Murray Hill Applebees clone passes off in their slidersit melted into unctuous joy inside my mouth with the barest modicum of chewing   Never a sweet tooth I was nevertheless amazed by each and every dessert course We started with a perfectly palate cleansing shiso sorbet followed by an exceptional yogurt rhubarb and sake geleé I dont understand the green tea with milk chocolate concoction that melted away like cotton candy as soon as you put it in your mouth but I liked it The meyer lemon cookie was as good as cookies can be and the last bite a gooey soy caramel that burst forth through the thinnest layer of chocolate it couldve been the best of them all  Was it a perfect meal No Some combinations were not as successful as others The lobster was underdone for my liking and the abalone moved past forgettable into unappetizing But the overall effect was magnificent  Is it worth it for you to dine here I cant answer that for you Its a lot of money and that cash could translate into six or seven meals at quality restaurants or you know rent But Im certainly happy I went I think you will be too    Doesnt she look good for 50 Dont kill me lady Im just kidding ',\n",

       " 'i absolutely LOVE this place Chef Ramirez is such a wonderful chef So kind and personable I love the japanese mexican and french influences in his food and the plating is just beautiful The charcoal grilled tuna was so worth it on its own and surprising the vegetables This is a must go every time hubby and I go to New York The staff is the utmost best staff and always so friendly ',\n",
       " 'SO MANY COURSES I wanted to take photos to document the meal but was told I was not allowed to This did not stop me from sneaking a few pictures The courses as best I can remember I am sure I forgot a few and they are out of order  Started with trout roe on a cracker Very good  Uni with black truffle My first time having uni Tastes like a sponge filled with chlorine Not to my taste but my dining companions liked it   Osetra caviar with sturgeon foam OBSCENE So delicious And I felt like a big baller eating it  Lobster with butter Also delicious  Some kind of fish with risotto Fell super flat  Foie gras in a soup Also fell flat  Pickled vegetables in a miso sauce Wonderful flavors and textures  Wagyu beef with a heart of palm and a bit of radish The wagyu was delicious of course but Ive had better wagyu before  Duck breast with huckleberries Loved it So tender and fatty with a crispy skin  Some kind of ice creamI forget what But it tasted like a green juice kale lemon celery apple ginger in ice cream form I loved it  Passion fruit ice cream WOW This is what gods py tastes like So sweet and tangy and creamy   Frozen chocolate souffle Also wonderful Delicate airy texture Milk chocolate flavor with a yogurtlike tang and some vanilla too  Mini financier and chocolate hazelnut truffles Delicious too  The pacing of the meal was not ideal There was a 30 minute gap between the fish and meat courses   The layout of the restaurant is such that everyone is seated around a table Who you are seated next to can VASTLY INFLUENCE your dining experience The dude sitting next to me was incredibly obnoxious He made dumb comments to the man serving and presenting the food telling him that he had no job security He was super loud and would not shut up Someone kept peeing on the toilet seat in the bathroom I bet it was him  The highlights were the Osetra caviar duck breast and the desserts Good Yes Overrated Yes ',\n",

       " 'Came here earlier in the year and had a fantastic meal Hard to imagine that Chefs Table originally started off as more Japanese as today I would have given it Japaneseinspired at most I sat at one of the middle tables with friends not at the counter We enjoyed trout roe tart a really great Japanese mackerel and radish an excellent sea perch with white miso Norwegian king crab with apple and shiso the everfamous uni with black truffle courseabsolutely amazing ossetra caviar koshihikari rice with black trufflea very interesting dish miyazaki beef and grapefruit sorbet with finger lime While I hear that the Manhattan location is not as good as the old Brooklyn location the space in Midtown West is much better Some may find it disorienting to walk through a grocery store to get to the 3Michelin star restaurant but I think it keeps the New York charm Of course service is topnotch and presentation was fantastic Highly recommend if youre willing to splurge ',\n",
       " 'Quite an amazing experience Each course is carefully designed and exquisitely executed  Personally I think the master piece we had is the vegetable dish mind you that this comes from a meatlover  each vegetable retains its own unique delicious fresh taste and harmoniously interacts with others   Now as a big wine head I think the wine paring I did a 4 glass tasting is also very decent  it was quite generous pours and they keep pouring even after you finish  1 It starts with a Chablis to go with fish and shell fish starters The slightly oaky Chablis does its job nothing complicated but decent  2 Chateau Simone Palette AC Provence Its a somewhat heavy white wine ClairetteGrenache Blanc grapes This is a wonderful paring with the dishes Mushroom broth chawanmushi etc 3 a Chateauneuf du Pape nicely fitted with the meat dishes 4 Tokaj amazing way to finish a meal with dessert    The only downside comes with sitting in essentially a kitchen to dine is that you get smokyoily smell on your hair and jacket  This does not bother us that much   Would come back again for sure ',\n",
       " 'As far as 3Michelin star experiences go CT is something special and very unique Walking into the grocery store and making your way to the back does not prepare you for the wonderful experience awaiting behind the sliding doors leading into the restaurant  First and foremost the staff far exceeded my expectations for the evening At this level of restaurant you expect perfection in service  but to have the staff so clearly be in sync and be laughing with you conversing and sharing details about you to assist one another with conversation and making you feel so comfortable was a high mark for BK Fare   I enjoyed the informal wine pairings as opposed to specific wines for each course Having the staff choose wines for a number of the courses felt more natural to me and I definitely enjoyed not ever feeling rushed in that way  Of course the food is something very special here  that is no secret The uni with black truffle is sublime caviar dish about halfway through was absolutely a favorite and rounding out my top three would be the almond frozen souffle Of course every course was expertly done and wonderful those 3 in particular though stole the show for me at least  Afterwards even sitting at the counter where time is more closely monitored than at the tables we never felt rushed We had some espresso and sake chatted with staff and among ourselves for a bit and finally reluctantly left We were completely satisfied and in agreement that we had experienced a resetting of the bar for best restaurant ',\n",

       " 'AMAZING   I wont divulge any part of the menu we experienced out of respect for the chef and to keep the mystery alive but I will say that it was an exception and incomparable experience  The meal is 95 seafood and you will be served fishes you have never tasted not seen on any other NYC menu  The deserts were mind blowing  We went to the 10 pm seating on a Friday When you get there the previous seating is still eating their deserts They are there for approximately 12 hour Table seated 10 for our time  We had 20 courses and all were amazing  Staff is kind yet very quiet You do not interact much with them which is understandable since they are creating your meal  Cant wait to go back in the summer to taste what seafood delights will be in season then  They are strict about their dress code FYI  Completely worth the 579 for two plus our wine bill 180 ',\n",

       " 'After 97 attempted calls to get through I finally got through to a live person and not the annoying busy signal At first I was shocked that it happened but now I am so thankful I took my bf to Brooklyn Fare this past weekend for his birthday and his quote was this was the best meal that Ive had in the US Coming from a guy who has ate at the likes of French Laundry Joel Robouchon and Benu I was very pleased and patted myself on the back that I was able to find a place that thoroughly impressed him  I have to say that this meal was SO spot on Each dish was perfectly executed the flavors were unique and blended together so well and the staff was amazing After reading reviews I was slightly concerned but Chef Ramirez was SO kind and talked to us throughout dinner We asked about his menu since it is very very Japanese influenced and he said its because he worked in Japan for 8 years   Sometimes you go to fine dining restaurants where the presentation is great but the food isnt spectacular Well we had 18 courses and each dish blew my mind away from the caviar and egg custard to the many sashimi dishes to the amazing risotto with uni and abalone the girl next to us literally used her finger at the end to eat up all of the remaining sauce  I was kind of grossed out but could relate bc I wanted to lick my plate duck with an apple mash and stuffed mushroom and to the shiso sorbet which I could have ate a pint of by myself I honestly could say that after every dish we looked at each other saying wow that was just amazing what are these flavors how did he make this can we have seconds You can tell he uses only the best ingredients  I had heard about what was written about Chef Ramirez and had the opposite experience We were sat closest to him my bf and I are Asian he talked to us throughout dinner he was very gracious to us at the end of dinner and thanked us for coming took a picture with us and seemed super kind to his staff He also walked around and talked to everyone when the meal was over and took pictures when requested regardless of who the diners were Maybe he is over compensating for everything that was written about him but I honestly didnt get that vibe from him at all The space is so small you literally can hear them talking the whole time and you can see exactly what they are doing so the whole rumor about giving Asians the worst pieces of meat  Im not sure how that would happen  EITHER WAY I dont care  I would recommend this experience to anyone The 3 Michelin stars are so well deserved I left feeling satisfied but not disgusting like how youd normally feel after 18 courses I cant wait to go back one day when Im back in NYC ',\n",
       " 'I have known about this restaurant for a long time I was supposed go here for dinner about a year ago but due to unforeseen circumstances I had to give up my seat to someone else However fast forward to one year later I finally got the opportunity to eat here again and I am so amazed with my experience Last night was one of the most memorable dining experiences I have ever had When we arrived we were seated around the bar top table and were sent on a ride of a lifetime We were told no pictures are allowed so I was forced to memorize all 15 courses in my head The Chef conducted his service like a maestro conducting an orchestra It was so smooth and seamless but what impressed me the most was how quite they were It was almost as if they were reading each others minds The symphony of food started with a red trout caviar tartlet which we paired perfectly with a nice glass of champagne This one bite first course was sensational and it wet our appetite for the rest of the meal Our 2nd course was Uni with a slice of black truffle It was crazy good Our 3rd course was a sabayon with potato and black caviar It was excellent Our 4th 5th and 6th course were Langoustines prepared 3 ways cold warm and hot They imported them from an island next to Norway They were so sweet and succulent Our 7th course was a sea bream in a basil sauce Our 8th course was one of my favorites It was a beautiful arrangement of seasonal vegetables and edible leaves Each vegetable had a different preparation and flavor profile It made me realize how great vegetables can be considering Im a big meat lover Our 9th course was another favorite it was a duck breast that was smoked and seared It was not too Gamey and cooked perfectly Our 10th course was another stand out It was Wagyu Beef imported from Japan It was so tender and buttery that it just melted in my mouth The 11th course was a Huckleberry Sorbet with fresh huckleberries It was a great palate cleanser Courses 1215 were all different types of desserts and hand made chocolates  Once again they were all amazing I know this place is very pricey but the quality of what you get is worth every dollar At the end of the meal we even had a chance to take a picture with the head chef by his kitchen work space ',\n",
       " 'I was lucky enough to snag a last minute here for my birthday last weekend And Im so glad I did because this was probably one of the best meals Ive had to date   I loved that the meal was heavily Japanese influenced starting with 79 courses of a modern take on sashimi followed by caviar truffle ravioli duck and wagyu And not one but TWO desserts Despite all the courses I walked away feeling comfortably but not IthinkImgoingtoexplodefull as I have at other establishments with lengthy tasting menus   Yes the price tag is hefty especially if you choose to get one of the 4 or 6 glass wine pairings with the meal But Chef Ramirez incorporates so many generous servings of luxury ingredients into his cooking that the price tag feels slightly justified   And for what its worth I did not once feel discriminated during my meal here The entire staff was incredibly professional and courteous though they are strict with photography but you can take as many photos as you like after the meal ',\n",
       " 'For my 1700th review I would like to share my experience at Brooklyns only 3 Michlein starred restaurant the Chefs Table at Brooklyn Fare  Michelin are a very traditional organisation and they usually make restaurants do their time at 1 star and 2 stars before promotion to the next level  I remember reading excitedly and sadly because it was so far away in the UK travel section about this intimate eatery opening surprisingly in Brooklyn and have followed its meteoric rise to being the holder of 3 Michelin stars in only 3 years  Seating only 18 guests I had low hopes of getting a reservation on my recent trip to New York as I was only in town for one day However on corresponding with the restaurant about their reservation process I was able to secure my reservation for the night I was in New York  They do have a clear but specific way of doing things A credit card secures your reservation and about a week before your visit they will charge your card for the full amount for dinner currently 225 tax and gratuity leaving you to only pay for drinks on the night They only serve one tasting menu which is decided at the last minute based on the best produce available The menu is heavy on seafood and diners are warned about this beforehand and it is pointed out that the menu isnt suitable for vegetarians  I met my New York fine dining friend Dana F who was joining for dinner at Brooklyn Fare deli to have a look round and get our appetite going There was amazing produce here and I thought one only had to walk round to get inspiration for an amazing meal However the ingredients for our meal was actually completely diffeent and a lot of it was imported directly from places like Japan just for the restaurant  The Chefs Table is located a few doors down from the deli You do feel like youve stepped into someones admittedly very posh kitchen with the 18 seats surrounding on 3 sides a central station manned or on our night womanned by a server and the chefs led by Cesar Ramirez doing their magic in the kitchen area on the 4th side I love the fact that you can see the chefs creating your food though theres little interaction with them except when Chef Ramirez comes round for a little chat  Guests are served in 2 groups with the start of the meal for the 2 groups staggered Service is top notch Michelin standard with seamless coordination between the kithcen the central server and the other servers round the outside managing drinks etc If anything it was a little serious though I did get Bryn our central server to smile and have a laugh with us by the end of the evening  My only gripe for the evening was that non drinkers werent catered for at all The only drink on offer was water though Bryn did a grand job at making sure my water glass was topped up the whole time The attention to detail extends to things like having chilled spoons for cold dishes  Brooklyn Fare is also famous for one thing which is pointed out to diners in the email that arrives with your booking  a strict no photos and no note taking policy Watching Chef Ramirez when he is plating up dishes I can understand why The look he gives his food is like a parent gazing upon a child  the pride is evident I think he just wants you to be savouring the food he creates concentrating fully on the flavours textures and temperatures  However as a Yelper it was so painfully frustrating for Dana and I to watch the more exquisitely beautiful creations pass before us without being able to get a visual or textual record of what we were eating Let me assure you that the presentation of the dishes is amazing  Starting with the most tomatoey tomato consomme and cucumber foam we were then treated to 20 plus dishes of exquisite Japanese inspired food Chef Ramirez later told us that a trip to Japan changed his whole persepctive to food and he pays homage in his cooking  The meal begins with a whole cold starter section of different fish flown in from Japan enhanced by various condiments and accompaniments The amount of work which goes into producing so many elements for all those dishes is mindboggling My favourite was Japanese crab brought to life with a zing of lime  In the hot section there was an amazing duck which had perfect crispy skin fat rendered to almost nothing and moist succulent meat That was probably my dish of the night but with over to enjoy you will find much to savour and remember about your meal here  Being professional celebrity chef stalkers Dana and I appreciated Chef Ramirez coming out for a chat Talking to him you can sense his passion for cooking and his commitment to keep his operation small in order to maintain his high standards Happily we were allowed an embargo on the no photos rule t get our picture taken with Chef Ramirez  A unique dining experience Yes there is great Michelin starred food to be found in Brooklyn ',\n",

       " 'I surprised my boyfriend with dinner here last night for his birthday Overall it was an incredible experience however there were a few fauxpas that should have not happened considering the three Michelin stars  Ill start with the good   The food is phenomenal Ive been to Jean Georges Per Se Eleven Madison Park Blanca Martin Berasategui and Astrance Id comfortably say the food is exactly on par with Blanca Blanca is like the Italian version of Chefs Table and Martin Berasategui is maybe just a hair better yes I know Im comparing apples and oranges The uni with black truffle is the best course followed by the langoustine then the roe then the fluke and the wagyu The squab was not good more on that later   The wine pairing was phenomenal Per our request our Captain emailed us a list of all the wines in the pairing so we can hopefully stock our cabinet with some of the more reasonably priced ones   I made sure our reservation was for the countertop as opposed to a dark booth in the back corner Im not sure why someone would want an isolated dark table all the way along the wall when you can instead watch the action happening before your eyes That is one of the best parts   Chef Ramirez was totally down to earth and friendly He made genuine conversation not canned phony small talk with my boyfriend and me for nearly five minutes at the start of dinner which made us feel great   our sommelier forgot her name but she is incredibly polite knowledgable and smiley was AMAZING She should honestly teach a training to the rest of the staff on social grace and people skills because that was seriously lacking amongst other key players of the team  Now the notsogood   Making a reservation here is a real pain in the tush I didnt have any connections I could work so I had to call Monday at 1030am six weeks in advance and I must have dialed 75 times in a row before giving up I tried calling again at around 1245pm that same day and finally got through to someone I was in disbelief when I got a table Moral of the story is dont give up and try calling back at random times during the day   I told the initial person I made the reservation with over the phone AND the person who called to confirm my reservation AND I wrote the restaurant back in their confirmation email to me that we are going for my boyfriends birthday You can imagine my shock and disappointment when our captain and two other members of the team asked if we were celebrating anything tonight Why yes thank you for asking even though I mentioned it was my boyfriends birthday only three times before coming here That kind of disorganized silly mistake is never something that should happen at a restaurant of this caliber I wouldnt even expect that at a onemichelin star restaurant   My boyfriend and I agree the worst offense besides not knowing it was his birthday and asking twice last night was the squab incident as we now jokingly refer to it One of the courses was squab and it honestly wasnt great No we are not picky eaters and we eat anything and everything except junk food and processed food however they need to replace the squab with another dish because it fell flat on so many levels The taste was just not appealing and it paled in comparison to outstanding dishes such as the uni with black truffle or even the wagyu We werent going to say anything about it because its just a few bites and we were taking everything in Our Captain asks us What did you think of the squab and my boyfriend gives a very honest concise response It wasnt my favorite Our captain then says what about it wasnt to your liking if I may ask My boyfriend replies Its not that it was bad its just when you just had these phenomenal dishes like the uni langoustine wagyu roe fluke etc the squab isnt anything special and just doesnt stand out  As my boyfriend is literally MIDSENTENCE responding to the question the Captain asked our Captain walks to another couple at the chefs counter to take their photo It was actually surreal My boyfriend and I looked at each other like did that really just happen For obvious reasons walking away from someone as theyre talking midsentence is incredibly rude and unprofessional It shows your priorities lie elsewhere meanwhile were the ones paying almost 1000 for this experience At the very least you can stick around and hear the answer you requested no  Additionally one of the kitchen serversrunners the person changing out our flatware throughout dinner was very kind however not the most suave There was a lot of distracting noisy clinking of flatware going on that was not necessary and could have been avoided with a little more finesse  This place only has one bathroom Its not professional to keep guests waiting in line at that price point Build a couple of more stalls there is plenty of room ',\n",

       " 'Wow best meal I have ever had  So more about me Im on a quest to hit all the Michelin 3 star and 2 star restaurants in New York City and other cities as well   Prior to this Eleven Madison Park was my favorite restaurant but Chefs Table takes my new favorite as most intimate special meal  The whole dinner was entirely different than anything Ive experienced  One enters the lab at the side of the Brooklyn Fare Grocery store and is seated in an industrial cooking kitchen  Its a bit chilly so ladies bring a sweater   The chefs at work are your visual in addition to the food and the kitchen is adorned by gleaming copper pots hanging above   Seating takes place in two stages with only 18 people having the privilege of dining here a night  We had the earlier seating at 7 and had the wine paring I think the experience will set you back 350400 once you tip    Each dish is a little morsel of delicious and I left the meal totally satisfied  Im not going to describe every dish bc this is not my forte but there is definitely a sashimi focus and a general fusion theme  I had a brief chance to chat with Chef Cesar Ramirez on my way to the ladies by the dishwashing station and he said he was inspired by his creations from his time in Japan   The only downside of Chefs Table is the impossibly difficult reservations  They take reservations 1x a week for 6 weeks out and phone lines are jammed  One has to prepay for dinner and its quite a chunk of change to shell out  But if you think about it one can easily drop 400 going to an average pre theater dinner and any show or the opera   If you are a foodie Chefs Table is a must go to on the list ',\n",
       " 'I was obviously hesitant about making and then keeping reservations for Chefs Table after the fallout of the accusations from a previous employee But I was determined to make this restaurant the focal point of my trip After seeing this restaurant and its food in the Brooklyn episode of No Reservations I was set on coming regardless of cost and the difficulty of securing a reservation And Im glad as is my wife we came  The service was warm and friendly and the sommelier was attentive and helpful The server was friendly engaging and attentive While the chef is certainly mild mannered and soft spoken he was engaging to my wife and I We were lucky enough to score the action seats next to the chef Maybe it was because we told them it was out 4th wedding anniversary that eveningor maybe I dialed the phone like crazy at exactly 1030 EST 6 months from the day of our reservation It is obvious Chef Ramirez is passionate and particular about the ingredients he uses the method of preparation for each dish and the presentation of the food Overall the service was spot on   We had too many dishes and I was enjoying my wifes company so my intent was not to remember every meal and recall the precise method of preparation or the ingredients used Although every dish was phenomenal I do recall a few dishes that were very memorable  There was a black cod dish that was so delicate and buttery The fish melts away in your mouth There was of course the uni and black truffle on brioche It was a great dish but surprisingly not my favorite of the night My favorite was the wild dover sole with cauliflower puree and radish I loved the liveliness they brought to the puree and how it paired so well with the delicate sole We are served a sisho and coconut sorbet as a palate cleanser which was surprisingly very good There was a hint of the vineyness from the shiso but it was the perfect intermission between the rich entree duck breast with a stuffed morel and the upcoming dessert courses  The most memorable dish of the night was the secondtolast dessert dish Again I wasnt paying too much attention to the preparation of the dish but it was essentially a gelato dusted with cocoa powder The sous chef proceeded to top that off with something resembling a pink muffin I was a bit taken back and very confused at this point The server saw my reaction smirked slightly and said This goes quickly I was left even more confused  When I took my first bite I was absolutely overwhelmed The muffin disappeared It didnt melt in my mouthit just disappeared and I was left with an explosion of flavor Amazingly innovative and most definitely creative What a way to end the meal of a lifetime  Id like to address some of the other points made in previous reviews While they make every effort to prevent excess noise from stack and clearing of plates this place is not devoid of sound There is soft music playing in the background you hear the sizzle of pans and crackle of the wood charcoal the murmuring of the chef and sous chefs soft chatter of the other guests and the clinking of forks against porcelain Yes there is a lack of decor in the restaurant but the simple utilitarian look is itself very pleasing Its functional and reminds you that you are there for nothing else but the food and wine   And while the server chef and sommelier do not chat it up with you between dishes they are friendly and courteous when you engage them The chef always asked what we thought of each dish as did the server in the middle I do not expect for them to carry on a conversation with me when there is certainly a lot that needs to be done for every service There is very little down time for each of them and we respected their space and time    Im surprised to find this many 1 and 2 reviews I understand that this type of food isnt for everybody we saw some unfinished dishes from our neighborsan absolute crime but the evening must have been a horrible trainwreck to warrant anything less than 4 And it seems highly unlikely that this place does not put forth its best effort each and every service ',\n",

       " 'Its like dinner theatre  Theres an open kitchen with 18 people sitting around it  After eating here I wondered why couldnt all restaurants do this  It felt so natural  The atmosphere wasnt stuffy at all as I would have expected from a 3Michelin star place  Part of this was probably due to the background music which consisted mostly of the Doors that night making the ambiance casual  Also despite the close proximity of diners to each other people werent afraid to converse during the dinner   The service was so fantastic  It was a perfectly choreographed show involving all of the servers Someone went around collecting the utensils after each course the hostess in the middle collected the dishes  The chefs plated each course in a line  It was so fascinating to watch the efficiency of it all  The food of course was amazing and beautiful  The starting courses were my favorite of the night  There was this uni dish that was probably my favorite  I dont even like uni normally  A good number of the dishes had freshly shaved truffle on them  One of the desserts was a truffleflavored ice cream with truffle shaving  Chef Ramirez started with a huge truffle at the beginning of the night and by the end it was shaved down to almost nothing  Oh man every time he went at it with the truffle I felt like a starstruck teen at a Bieber concert    My partner and I shared the wine pairing since neither of us are big drinkers  Im not sure if it added much to the meal except for the sheeps milk cheese which was paired amazingly with a sweet wine  Overall a FANTASTIC experience ',\n",
       " 'It was great and comparable to any Michelin three stars restaurant and can be better than some of them Was that the best meal for me No I enjoyed all the courses but didnt feel so thrilled that I have to jump out of my chair Overall it was great experience and worthy of every penny  Chef Ramirez was friendly humble and I really loved the way he interacted with us The service was very good but not as good as some of the Michelin three stars restaurants The atmosphere was ok I guess you come here and really want to watch the chefs cooking It is cool but if you really want romantic atmosphere it is definitely not for you I sat just next to the kitchen as a result my hair and my dress was soaked a lot kitchen smell felt very embarrassed  to walk around after dinner  Also the smoke from the kitchen made my eyes teary ',\n",
       " 'Im pretty sure Chefs Table has to be the hardest get of the highend restaurants in NYC given the absolutely cozy size 18 seats total of the restaurant Ive called in at 930 AM sharp on Monday morning and I never get through So I called in one afternoon and put myself on the waitlist for any day any time  and a month afterward when Id long forgotten about the call I got the Holy Grail  a couple seats for a 930 PM seating on Thursday night The entrance to the restaurant is not that noticeable  I nearly walked right by it once I got off the subway I think I was mesmerized when I stepped in because I totally missed Chef Ramirez standing right there greeting everyone who was coming in as well as everyone who was finishing up He seems quite softspoken and when the dinners being made he is generally keeping a close eye on everything thats being prepped That said if you are lucky enough to score seats closer to the action he definitely was chatting those people up more than us who were seated just about dead center from the cooking  Its hard to describe the food because a lot of it is something youll never have had before Definitely oriented towards seafood but with a distinct lean towards Asian particularly Japanese flavors Its very much like Le Bernardin  focusing on the seafood with one meat dish at the end That said  there is magic being concocted in front of you and having it all done in front of you is amazing You know youre in for a good meal when they smoke up a small glass bowl and bring you an applewoodsmoked oyster as your first dish I dont know if Ive ever had a smoked oyster much less one with that much intense smoky delicious flavor The start of the meal in my opinion is the real tour de force  after the oyster youre hit with bluenose sashimi which is served with a phenomenal shiso sauce captures the flavor but without the strong intensity of the leaf itself and crispy kelp to add a dash of saltiness The sea perch comes next with a black vinegar that pairs off really well My favorite dish had to be the uni with a slice of black truffle on top I think truffle makes just about anything better but with the rich oceansalty flavor of the uni  its pure magic Youre then hit with a cauliflower soup served with a generous helping of caviar  and I do mean generous Most restaurants will give you a tiny amount but Chef Ramirez cracks open 3 cans when serving everyone Next was his take on chawanmushi  with a much more viscous egg custard if you can even call it that with a piece of foie gras to richen it up  After this you start getting into dishes with bigger portions The golden eye snapper was prepared so well with the highlight being the crispy skin of the fish that just melts apart in your mouth You get a hearty slice of wild turbot next which was really juicy and succulent covered in a roasted potato foam  but the highlight could very well be the brussel sprouts Instead of getting the dense sprouts theyre decomposed into their individual peels yet they retain the same rich flavor The lobster was next which was surprisingly one of the less memorable dishes If anything I really loved the bouillabaisse reduction that coated the fresh tail meat A small pause for Japanese rice with white truffle Chef Ramirez shaves off a hearty amount for this which basically tastes like a fantastic macaroni and cheese but with a different texture A slice of abalone is next perhaps my least favorite dish more because it wasnt as memorable than because it was not good followed the only meat dish  a seriously fatty slice of Kobe beef served with grated daikon to temper the juiciness  The desserts themselves were also incredibly done We got a slice of Brielike sheeps milk cheese served with yuzu marmalade  a great pairing of the creamy and the acidic Next was shiso sorbet which was perfectly done  it has the deep green of the leaf and a stronger flavor of shiso than other similar sorbets  but without the bite of the leaf My favorite had to be the white truffle ice cream with a dash of caramel and more white truffle in the form of shavingsit very much has a savory flavor but it works so well in what is typically a sweet dish Paired with the caramel and it is a scoop of pure heaven We finished up with a chocolate and vanilla truffle which seemed like the coating was made from rice paired with deliciously unsweetened soba ice cream  The creativity of the dishes is incredible and were it not for the impossible nature of getting a seat and the fact that this burns a big fat hole in your wallet 650 for 2 including tax and service charge  before any wine I would be back in a heartbeat Its not just for having a fresh memory but Chefs Table as of now  theres a lot more food out there is my new favorite restaurant You watch a masterpiece being built  and then you eat each and every one ',\n",

       " 'Chefs Table Review  I had been trying to get a reservation at Chefs Table for over 6 months You can only call between 10 am and 2 pm on Mondays only and that does make it hard So imagine my surprise when I finally got through and had someone on the phone Who then told me that they only had room for a four top Would I like to book that Sure why not Im sure I could find another couple to join us  Only when the day came they had a family conflict and had to cancel I had a week shouldnt be a problem no This restaurant has a waiting list Only they refused So I reached out to everyone I could came up empty Again I reached out to the restaurant They said they would do their best  ask the chef anyone who might have people who wanted to come in Then he forgot to tell me that he had come up empty So yeah In the end I went there as a two top but paid for a four top in the end over 1000 They refused to refund the two empty seats And no they didnt give us bigger portions either  So This gets better Brooklyn Fare is adamant about you being on time So we showed up 15 minutes early which apparently was too early They werent ready So they offered that we could sit in a waiting area in the grocery store next door Remember the dress code Formal In the past the chef has sent people to a nearby store to purchase clothes when he deems them under dressed So Ever want to feel like a complete jerk Try walking around a grocery store on Schermerhorn in a suit Then sit in a small waiting area next to the check out lanes  Finally theyre ready for us and we sit The room its self is tight but theatrically well laid out with a massive rack of copper cookware framing the kitchen The staff is decked out in crisp linens and everything felt in order We were unceremoniously sat down to a clean and modern setting complete with Ercuis flatware and FoH porcelain We then had an initial chat with the sommelier who introduced us to a shallow and overpriced wine list We asked for a recommendation for a glass that would work well with the first few plates and she picked out a Sauvignon Blanc When she went to the glass caged wine rack Chef César intercepted her had a quick chat with her and pointed her to a different bottle Which she then presented to us and poured Without mentioning that it was different than what she had recommended It was a Sancerre Quite a bit different  The first dish was then placed in front of us without explanation by the single server working the center of the pass A lovely bite of a clean Tomato sorbet with a wonderful tang of Lemongrass It exploded with a delicate melange of flavor that was sweet sour clean and beautiful all at once In my head I growled Damn you Chef César despite all of this youre going to win me over But that was to be the highlight of the evening What followed was mostly a series of well sourced but uninspired plates As it was summer sashimi dominated the 14 plates we experienced a far cry from the lauded 20 small plate courses most of which while fresh were sometimes flat in flavor And my partner who is gluten intolerant merely saw all of the gluten removed from the dishes I was served rather than a rethinking  Not to say that it was all for naught While the evening provided us with few highlights there were actual highlights The aforementioned Tomato and Lemongrass sorbet and a brilliant mouthful of Uni and black truffle unguent and delicate both lived up to the reputation   With the final dessert plates we were offered our choice of espresso based drink Oily and black and bitter on the tongue the bean was over roasted but moreover the shots had been burned most likely because they had been overpacked and then pulled with very little crema which indicates they were overlong and watery  In the end what we experienced was not a chefs table at all The chef walked around the seats once slapped me on the shoulder and walked off And that was it He put a lot of smears across plates added some garnish but that was the extent of his performance Our server had to be repeatedly asked about the food which she would then describe in a quick and straightforward manner devoid of any desire for enhancing the experience for us And when we asked about the caviar she told us that it was Osteria Caviar farmed in China Which at Per Se prices frankly shocked us that they would a serve such a product and b describe it as though it was premium As a final insult on our way out a couple asked the servers to call them a taxi  they were told that they could hail a yellow cab anywhere on the street  3 Michelin Stars Never Again Go to Atera where chef Matthew Lightner delivers on the promise of what a Chefs Table can be Or Blue Hill at Stone Barns where Dan Barber has consistently provided me with the best food Ive ever eaten Or 15 East which IMHO serves the best Japanese food in NYC ',\n",

       " 'First Id like to say whoever started the rumors that Chef Ramirez is a racist is an idiot He has an Asian staff member lived in Japan for 8 years and his food is Asian influenced There are chopsticks in the setting Not only that he is one of the nicest Chefs I have ever met He is not one of those Chefs on their high horses We even saw him bring the dishes to the back a few times I really doubt someone who trained in Japan is going to be racist against Asians Anyhow on to the experience and food  Chefs Table at Brooklyn Fare is a small intimate restaurant It has 18 seats around a server in front of the kitchen The staff was very polite and knowledgeable  Luckily we were sat on the end so we got to have a few conversations with Chef Ramirez  My wife and I split a 6 flight wine pairing along with our 18 course meal she doesnt drink much The pairings were excellent  Although Im not big on whites but these pairings were excellent with the seafood  All of the dishes were amazing  If you dont like Japanese food or seafood then you might want to try a different 3 star restaurant  Personally I have never had a tasting where I enjoyed every single dish this much  The most memorable dishes were the golden eye snapper and uni brioche  There were only two meat courses wagyu and duck both cooked to perfection  All of the ingredients were excellent no extra salt or sauce to hide any flavors  Everything was refined and highlighted the proteins and ingredients  The desserts were light and flavorful very refreshing  I did not leave feeling too full like Per Ses tasting it was just the right amount of food  The overall experience was perfect  The staff even put sheets between the plates to minimize noise  This was one of the best meals Ive had in my life  I would give it 6 stars if I could  Reading some of the negative reviews on here reminds me why I think most of our population is dumb  Half of the complaints were about not having enough conversation the setting restaurant policies no pictures difficult reservations etc  The restaurant emails you their policy if you dont like them then go somewhere else  It is that simple  I dont want to sit next to someone dressed like a slob or next to someone snapping away with a DSLR in such an intimate setting  For all the people complaining that the Chef didnt talk to them much you come to a restaurant to eat not talk to the Chef the whole time  Does Thomas Keller come out and talk to you at Per Se or French Laundry  He probably is never there So what if he talked to others more than you  You are probably boring and look like an arrogant person  Enjoy your meal and talk to the company you brought I bet if it were the reverse and the staff and Chef conversed too much people would complain too I havent written a review this long in awhile but I had such an amazing experience and was annoyed reading all the idiotic negative reviews I had to  I feel bad that such a genius Chef has to deal with all these moronic reviewers on Yelp ',\n",

       " 'The Chefs Table has listened  That is the most significant finding of my experience at the Chefs Table last Saturday night Nobody of sane mind would question argue or debate the intense quality taste and presentation of the food served here I cant remember finding one review that said otherwise So my review will not focus on what should be uncontested the amazing food experience you are sure to have Instead I want to focus on what many people did have issues with the sommelier server and more frequently the chef himself I am happy to say those issues are being contested  I was lucky enough to score a gift certificate to eat here from a very dear friend as a wedding present What a great wedding present right So prior to going I did a lot of homework reading the last years worth of reviews from Fodders TripAdvisor and here not to mention many critics reviews A common thread emerged from the many of the reviews the service Stuffy cold or rude wait staff no explanation of the dishes no photos allowed and then theres the chef Whether he was unfriendly didnt like playing host didnt engage with the patrons even though this IS the Chefs Table or just being mean there were many people saying the same thing I even recall reading two separate reviews where as patrons were leaving the chef stood there at the door not saying a thing and presumably waiting for them to thank HIM So I was pretty worked up on the way there running through my head that if I witnessed any of this I was going to address it After all there was no way I was going to let a wonderful wedding present like this be tainted by a diva chef that cant get out of his own way   But just the opposite happened The sommelier was a pleasure and when I told him my plan of starting with Champagne them move on to white and then to end with red he gave timing of when to make the transition and offered suggestions along the way He was overly friendly and sweet The server was just great I cannot see anyone having a problem with her She explained every dish even though we were almost last in the line was friendly and actually really personable We were chatting her up throughout the meal and instead of being short and just giving halffriendly smiles she engaged in conversation with us She really added to our dining experience   And then there is Caesar He made sure to say hello to everyone my husband and I separately in fact and it was one of those hand on the shoulder warm hellos too Now granted he actually ended up having a full on conversation with every couple there but us I didnt hold that against him though because my husband and I were in full on conversation the majority of the meal and enjoying ourselves I didnt feel the need to have a conversation with him just for the sake of it However watching him work the room was nice to see Now dont get me wrong I would probably tend to agree with the people who say we should lower our expectations of chefs and that they usually arent the best playing host We want them to cook well and Chef certainly does But even if he wasnt 100 into it he played the game and I thought pretty well  All in all all of the complaints made of this place I think have been for the most part resolved However I have come up with some different ones First where we were sitting we were listening to the dishwasher the entire evening I get it that they have to clean the dishes and being we were the last seating they probably didnt want to be there all night after we left But I have to say it was distracting They will be renovating the space soon please take care of this Also there was sorbet and three dessert courses all of them being ice cream I was looking for some cake or pastry of some sort so the allice cream thing was a surprise I was also surprised that there was no cheese course I normally dont look forward to these courses but for whatever reason this time I was   Small things to complain about in an otherwise amazing dinner The first four sashimi courses and the wagyu beef was the most amazing thing I ate all night All in all dont let the previous negative reviews prevent you from experiencing a meal everyone needs to have at least once Maybe twice if you are lucky ',\n",

       " 'I am so so conflicted about this one The food was outofthisworld amazing but the service fell short I was expecting way more servicewise from a restaurant with 3 Michelin Stars  Predinner  I cant comment on the reservation process since the American Express concierge service took care of that We got a 930pm seating which is much later than I usually eat dinner but we were happy to get a reservation at all  You are told to arrive on time or else you may miss courses Punctuality is important I get that But what happens when you show up 15 minutes early which in my book is on time There is no waiting area You either have to linger around awkwardly outside or in the little weather vestibule thing or find something to do for 15 minutes I saw no bars or coffee shops or anything other than a parking garage in the immediate area so I stood outside like a creeper It was really strange and did not give me good feelings about dinner  Food  To my relief after we received our first course all my judgments were erased The food was on a completely different level Every little bite was so complex and so elevated It was course after course of sheer delight we were disappointed when our first dessert course came because that was the signal it was almost over When it comes to the food believe the hype  I just wish they could have given me a copy of their menu so I could remember what we ate Its a little thing that would have made the experience that much better And a signed menu would have been even more special  Service  Unfortunately the service fell short of my expectations It was by no means BAD but it was not the flawless execution I expected with a 255 meal  For starters my water and wine glasses should have never been empty well until the wine was done I was disappointed that I had to wait for both my water and wine to be refilled more than once  I also found the presentation of each dish to be rather terse The description of each course was Something with something That was it Nothing else The server was almost too polished and too professional if that makes any sense Oh and I found it strange that the chefs did not serve one dish Whats the point of sitting in the kitchen if there is zero interaction with those preparing your food   Speaking of which the kicker was our interaction with Chef Cesar himself There was none He made his way around the table talking to most if not all of the other diners except us Fine whatever hes busy in the kitchen and maybe he got sidetracked I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt But at the end of the meal we thanked him and very politely asked to get a picture with him and we were told he doesnt take pictures I know that is a lie Ive seen photos of diners with him on Yelp and Instagram and so did one of my dining companions which is why we thought it was OK to ask So what the hell It left a very poor taste  figuratively  in our mouths at the end of the meal It made me feel like I was not welcome and after our party dropped 1k on a meal it was not a good feeling Ive read that hes shy but thats not an excuse to treat us differently from his other guests And if hes shy and doesnt like doing the whole front of the house thing maybe his restaurant shouldnt be in the kitchen Just sayin  TLDR Food was AMAZING but the rest of the experience was meh The food brings the average way up to a 4 but Im not sure I would return Id rather drop that same  at a place like EMP Le Bernardin etc and be treated like a queen ',\n",

       " 'The food was uniformly excellent but I kind of hate this place at least a little  I mean a meal costs 225 per person with 20 gratuity on top charged before you walk in the door  If you cant make it you swallow the whole cost  If you come late we were late  sigh you miss part of the meal  All this is whatever I guess  Restaurants are allowed to charge as much as they can get away with and I understand the stiff rules  If you think of the three hour dinner here as a prepaid show you can even understand why you give up part of the entertainment on a late arrival  But  all this should buy a handsome thoroughly enjoyable experience  Not so  The reservation system is fucked up  My mom called to inquire about booking a spot and the guy on the phone told her to call back the coming Monday  When she got through on that specified day after over 400 attempts the same guy told her to call the next week  he had made a mistake  Thankfully he was able to find us a spot but he gave my mom a hard enough time that she almost cried  And once we arrived service was just not good  It was competent and somewhat formal but cold as ice  I liked the setting  intimate 18 counter seats with a full view of all the prep with a waitress circling the middle  but it was so metallic and joyless I felt like I was watching surgery  I suspect the management heard that curt clinical service is prestigious that it shows that an expensive prepaid meal is still a privilege  Obviously as an OCD Yelper Im going to complain about the no photo no notes policy  Look its pretentious as hell but I kind of get the no photos  But no notes  I tried anyway just took notes on my phone under the table thinking the purpose of the policy was to not bother other customers  Nope  Halfway through one of the servers stopped me  The policy is in place because Brooklyn Fare has some notion of keeping itself a super prestigious black box  Well fuck that  I derive a lot of my enjoyment from a meal in its lasting impression and photos and menus add a lot of value to my dining  400 should buy a detailed account  So I found a loophole  Lets just say its my photographic memory  I gather we missed around four courses and ate somewhere around twenty with glasses of Sancerre and champagne and Burgundy along the way  The food was delicious heavy on seafood with beautiful flavors and plating  I had a few favorites  The King salmon with trout roe cilantro and onion was a top grade piece of fish buttery and fresh accented by the burst of roe and the clean green cilantro sauce  San Diego sea urchin with black truffle and brioche exploded on my palate a bite of ultimate luxury  Octopus came cooked to a perfect yielding firmness with hearts of palm and cucumber to augment its flavor and texture  And finally I loved a small bowl of smoked cod and potato topped with a heap of black caviar  The rest of the dishes were less memorable but never less than superb  We started in time for a few fanciful morsels of premium sushi  First there was jackfish with sunchoke arugula ginger and sesame then the King salmon then hiramasa with golden trout roe crispy burdock root and a hit of mustard then that lovely uni  Next came Portuguese sardine with sage and a potato chip after that a small bowl of jumbo lump crab with shredded phyllo scallop and cucumber yogurt  The meal continued with the octopus and smoked cod with a meaty piece of langoustine in between coated in a fragrant Iranian saffron sauce  A seafood custard brought flavors of truffle dashi shrimp uni chives and black pepper in a dish reminiscent of a chawanmushi  The next two dishes brought larger fillets of fish  delicate redscaled rouget with Japanese rice and Thai curry and turbot with black truffle and sunchoke  The rouget was perfectly cooked but the rice wasnt great and the curry a bit meek  The turbot dish had a stronger profile with flavors that bloomed  The meal leaned away from seafood for its final movement starting with a transitional plate bearing bites of lobster veal agnolotti abalone and foie gras  All good none extraordinary  Then there was tender duck with porcini mushroom and miso salsify and to segue to dessert sheeps milk cheese with pear balsamic and crouton  I loved the intermezzo of blood orange and Greek yogurt sorbet  For dessert there was a spiced tonka bean ice cream with chocolate and gold and finally vanilla cake with tangerine granola and Riesling ice cream  The desserts were not the highlight but they were certainly good  Chocolate caramels sent us out the door  For all the glorious food I couldnt muster much love for this meal  Sure the food was essentially flawless but best Ive ever had  A solid no  Ive had better meals with great service at enough restaurants for less money that I dont have to come back to Brooklyn Fare ever again ',\n",

       " 'From what I had read this wouldnt be just any fancy meal Brooklyn Fare is also the name of the gourmet grocery store next door and five times a week the chef César Ramirez prepares a huge meal for a very intimate group But the whole thing is under the guise of a class You have to reserve a spot in advance or get on the waiting list as I did back in February bring your own wine and then César teaches you about cooking while cooking for you and from reviews and word of mouth you get to try amazing food  We arrived at 7 and were greeted by a sweet waitress It almost felt like a community of students but it never fully got there for me Maybe my expectations were too high  or maybe the whole concept has changed since word of mouth has made it a bigger deal But this was not a class It was maybe an observation But there was no introduction no greeting we barely heard the chef explain each dish as we received it He sort of mumbled what it was and if you caught it you caught it  But even if you didnt know what you were eating it was still all ridiculously delicious The amuse bouches started coming fast and furious There must have been close to 10 little bites And they were all outstanding  I specifically remember a watermelon slice perfectly coated with olive oil and sea salt a sardine strapped to a potato chip and a plump oyster with oyster gelatin and yuzu Every single bite was explosive with texture and balanced flavors I knew we were in for something truly special  Then we referred to our program read menu which was the only hint that there was a syllabus The eight courses were divided thusly salmon tomato scallop egg black bass ravioli beef strawberry Now I have to do my best to remember the specifics of each It explicitly said on the menu not to take notes or photos It hinted that it was because they want us to enjoy the food without any distractions So for the first time in a while I had to rely on my mental note taking skills  The salmon was a parfait that was almost as small as the amuses with lots of fish roe and a rich egg cream of sorts It was good but I didnt realize we had technically started the meal I was waiting for some direction or lesson I guess all I needed to do was eat And I did it  The tomato course was probably his masterpiece We watched as the sous chefs all helped compose the sixpart dish that featured tomatoes every possible way you can imagine Even the ways you cant imagine including my favorite the tomato marshmallow Each component was explosive with flavor And you kept finding more components to the components like the little gazpacho underneath the white tomato mousse And of course as almost an afterthought or palate cleanser we got a scoop of some sweet spicy tomato sorbet It was fantastic  Everything was a surprise the poached egg was topped with rich earthy summer truffles the ravioli held some tender rabbit meat and the beef had a rich buttery foie gras on top so if we werent full enough we were certainly stuffed by the time dessert rolled out  Except it wasnt completely satisfying I felt the meal sort of fizzled out Dont get me wrong I loved every little thing we ate It was so masterfully prepared and presented with seasonal ingredients and unique combinations Everything was great But I wanted more And before you think me greedy let me explain The strawberry dessert was fresh and summery with a tangy greek yogurt sorbet But after all those canapes to start I thought we would maybe have a petit fours or two or four I still wanted closure  both with the meal chocolate would have been nice and with the show itself  The chef tended to really engage the people on both corners of the long bar We were smack in the middle and while we got a nod or two and probably had the best visual seats in the house I felt a little gypped Maybe my expectations were too high after that bang of a beginning Maybe the class has changed since its grown in popularity they will soon be getting a liquor license and are now seating more people each night Maybe those couples on either end were regulars although Im not sure how thats even possible I dont know but I left a little unfulfilled while pleasantly full  The Kitchen at Brooklyn Fare served fantastic food and it was a really exciting albiet expensive evening out I did feel like I was involved in some secret club but that only the most exclusive people could get front seats And I wonder if those guys walked away with a chocolate truffle or two Because I had to get mine at the grocery store next door  eatthisny ',\n",

       " 'I will open by stating that I have not eaten at the Chefs Table at Brooklyn Fare and that I have only heard raves from people who have  Three friends and I snagged a hardtoget reservation there a few weeks ago for a special occasion in October 2011 and we were excited to go  But we ended up canceling our reservation due to seriously confusing messaging regarding pricing and what we perceived to be insulting customer service policies on the part of the restaurant  Bear with me and Ill explain how the Chefs Table lost our business  1 Cost of Meal AutoGratuity When we obtained the reservation our understanding was that the cost of the meal per person was 185 before tax gratuity and beverage costs  A confirmation email sent by the restaurant a few weeks later stated Price   18500 pp plus tax and 20 service fee  This was the first we had heard of the service fee and we initially thought that they were now bundling the cost of the meal with mandatory gratuity  I wouldnt have had a problem with that actually  Per Se does the same thing  But the email also stated Gratuity is not included it is at your discretion the evening of your dinner  Gratuity is CASH ONLY  By the way THE USE OF ALL CAPS IS REALLY CLASSY FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE JOINT  Taking the restaurant at their word we assumed that the 20 fee did not represent the gratuity and reasoned the following cost structure per person not including beverage 18500 dinner  875 sales tax  20 service fee  20 standard discretionary gratuity  This came to approximately 275way more than what we originally expected to pay and btw just 20 shy of the cost of dinner and service at Per Se  As the restaurant stated to Eatercom it turns out that its email was incorrect regarding the service fee and it did intend for this fee to represent a mandatory gratuity charge  See httpnyeatercomarchives201109brooklynfare2php  So the confirmation email was in error and one would like to think not purposefully misleading  The Eater post also notes that the restaurant has subsequently decided that prepayment of gratuity is optional  2 Cost of Meal Beverage Cost The Chefs Table at Brooklyn Fare started out as a BYOB establishment and this was definitely a major selling point  When we got the reservation however a rep on the phone reported with certainty that the restaurant would have its liquor license by the date of our meal and would no longer offer BYOB  We were slightly disappointed but still generally excited for the meal  Then the confirmation email came  It read simply Currently BYOB this may change  We were perplexed  So we might have the option of bringing our own booze but we may also be required to buy markedup booze from the restaurant  The restaurant was clearly hedging its bets and we had no assurance that we would be informed in advance which policy would apply to our meal  And we had no idea of knowing what kind of alcohol offerings and pricing the restaurant might adopt  For all we knew we might be forced to spend 100 per person on a coursed wine pairing  This was the real dealbreaker  Is it unreasonable for a diner to expect to have some vague notion of how much theyll spend at a restaurant in advance of their meal  3 Requiring a NonRefundable PrePayment The restaurant required prepayment by credit card seven days in advance of our reservation date  At first this seemed understandable as noshows and lastminute cancellations could dramatically affect the profitability of such a business  It is an 18seat restaurant  Yet again the restaurants confirmation email undermined my willingness to comply with this relatively unorthodox policy because it was not upfront about what costs required prepayment  It stated 100 of the dinner fee will be charged 7 days prior to the day of the reservation and is nonrefundable  So 185  Or 185  20 service fee  Or 185  20  875 sales tax  Should one have to beg a restaurant for such crucial details  And would they be following up in the event that BYOB was no longer an option and require prepayment for previously unadvertised alcohol costs as well  This confusion coupled with the lingering question of whether if I got hit by a bus six days in advance of the meal I might be refunded by Brooklyn Fare which would probably have plenty of time to leverage its waitlist just added to the already unacceptable degree of frustration associated with this reservation  A lot of people have obviously really enjoyed their time at this restaurant  For us though the confusing terms dictated by this business in advance of our reservation were unacceptable for a restaurant so highly regarded ',\n",

       " 'I came here to celebrate our anniversary and if you had to have one takeaway from my experience having been to Per Se just a few months ago Per Se was a much more lux experience with a price tag to match unfortunately Eleven Madison Park feels a bit like Per Ses rebellious younger sibling  where Per Se is constrained highbrow and perhaps a bit pretentious for some Eleven Madison Park has a touch of whimsy and fun To explicate there were these brightly colored blue and black wooden boxes on our table The server soon explained to us that it was a partnership with an artist to encourage us to put our phones in the box so we can dine technologyfree Our servers also had more of an amicable and casual affect than at EMP  Anyhow we ordered the tasting menu with the cheaper wine pairing For the fish meat and dessert courses you were given a choice between two different options This unfortunately led to a server mistakenly swapping our dishes Now it really isnt a big deal but EMP is supposed to be a three Michelin star restaurant with the highest attention to detail and that server never darkened our table after that big faux pas I also thought the wine pairing was a little less memorable overall than what I had at Per Se although there was a beer served with the cheese course which again is apropos with that slight irreverence that I think EMP is trying to evoke  One of my favorite dishes was the mushroom course They brought out a freshhewn boulder of mushroom to demonstrate how much it cooks down The mushroom was exquisite It was savory and umami and there was extracrisp outsides and some extrameaty and fleshy insides I also really enjoyed the lobster for which the halibut was an alternative  it was cooked to perfection just the right amount of doneness  I think where EMP is outshined by Per Se is in the little accoutrements if you will The little amuse bouches while creative in concept trufflefilled dosas with broth tea etc just didnt taste great It was soggy and not as crisp as I had hoped The bread basket offered by EMP was just one bread It was good but it wasnt remarkable As were the desserts  Per Se gives you a whole bevy of desserts with not one but two take home petit fours while EMP just had the one main dessert entree with a peanut butter chocolate candy and some granola to take home All of it was delicious of course but just not quite as upscale Also nothing quite beats the spectacular view at Central Park that Per Se has  All in all Im starting to think that theres no way to get a good deal when youre dining at the Michelin threestarred level it seems like you truly get what you paid for ',\n",

       " 'As a former best restaurant in the world winner expectations were running high EMP has been on my list of places to visit for almost a decade It was on my radar before it rose from a two to three star Michelin restaurant but now its kind of a big deal in the restaurant world I decided to take my fiancee for our three year anniversary but Ive also been hearing mixed reviews on their most recent tasting menu and decided to opt for the abbreviated bar tasting menu instead on our most recent visit to NYC  that would later be a regretful decision  We arrived a couple minutes early for our reservation but were quickly seated at a large private table near the bar The bar seating is tucked away in the back and a much darker area compared to the brightly lit main dining hall Our first course was already awaiting to be opened in front of us with a box that held two black and white cookies if you dont know what these are theyre synonymous with NYC and everywhere in the city Except the twist was that the black and white cookie was a cheese cookie with cheddar and apple filling   Our next course was my favorite of the evening the caviar Benedict with corn and smoked sturgeon It literally tasted like an amazing deconstructed Benedict served in a caviar tin with bread It was beautifully presented but even more important so flavorful with every scoop and bite The menu started diverging with choices of a few courses We tried both the foie gras and the crab next The foie gras was marinated with eggplant and mint and was very rich in flavor In contrast the crab dish was presented with a salad of zucchini and lemon and was elegantly plated like everything else but the flavor was very light and refreshing  The fourth course was the lobster grilled with greens and bean ecrasse Having recently traveled from New England we had eaten three lobster rolls in two days and were pretty lobstered out But this lobster was simply cooked to perfection and arguably better than the fresh lobster rolls we were eating in Maine which was mindblowing to me There were only three small morsels but each was packed with flavor  The main courses consisted of a dry aged beef and grilled with peppers and an aged duck honey and lavender glazed with blueberries and onion Of the two the beef was the winner and my second favorite dish of the meal By itself the beef was good but eaten with the peppers took it to another level Something as simple as this was made so well was quite impressive The duck was a little on the tough side for my liking but the flavors were great nonetheless  For dessert we chose a cheese course with a triple creme in brioche with cherry and basil creme fraiche which again had so many flavors between the sweet cherry and the creamy cheese within the brioche For the other we chose the blackberry ice cream and granita with caramelized milk and lemon The presentation was very minimalist but it was quite tasty Dinner ended with a delicious chocolate covered peanut butter pretzel served with brandy  As a bonus I requested to tour the kitchen as I wouldnt know the next time I would be back Its definitely not guaranteed as they had to work a few things out but we were treated to a short viewing to the new renovated kitchen The kitchen didnt look like a typical restaurant kitchen instead reminiscent of an immaculate lab with so many moving pieces working in perfect synchrony As a parting gift we were given a very nice glass jar of granola to have for breakfast the next day which was amazing as well  The bar tasting dinner lasted around 25 hours so I cant imagine how long the typical tasting would take Booking is through Tock months in advance and cost 175 gratuity and tax included which is quite a good price given a 3 star Michelin and consistently in the top 5 Best Restaurants in the World rankings I would definitely return to try the full tasting menu next time and highly recommend coming here ',\n",

       " 'A somewhat belated review of a truly memorable lunch experience in March  This restaurant has been on my bucket list for a while but every time I came to New York I couldnt manage to get a table  When I knew I would be coming for a conference I booked a table for lunch the only time available for my dates months in advance  I started calling all my NYC crew but no one was available to join me  I cast my net further afield to Philly and Boston and one of my Boston friends answered the gastronomic call  He had to take a bus and come in just for the day but proclaimed it totally worth it  With three Michelin stars and the title of the Best Restaurant in the World there was a lot of expectation going in to the Sunday lunch   On arrival we were ushered into a cathedrallike space with soaring ceilings and an austere but welcoming Art Deco décor mostly whites with touches of blue including a truly spectacular large abstract painting on the far wall  Seated in a cozy corner banquet we were greeted like we were a combination of royalty and long lost friends by our servers  The cocktail menu had several unusual combinations I opted for one containing gin and horseradish among several other things  After a few sips I actually felt sad as I knew I would never have another cocktail as good as this one  It was everything I ever wanted in a cocktail and more  The cocktail by which all other cocktails will be forever judged and found wanting    On the pristine white tablecloth there was an intriguing white box tied with string  I assumed it would a parting gift to be taken home but yay we were allowed to open it right away  Inside were two small savory black and white cheese cookies  A delightful bite to kick off the meal   Our first course was the scallop which was served raw with sea urchin  Delightful and fresh  The next dish was incredibly intricate and really showed off the subtle skills of the chef the caviar with smoked ham and hollandaise a sort of deconstructed eggs benedict  There was a lot going on with this dish but it all came together in a very sophisticated way    There were multiple other courses which I could go on about for great length but one does run out of superlatives after a while I do need to note the mushroom tart which was another beautifully presented and complex dish and the duck glazed with honey and lavender    We were offered a choice of three desserts and each chose one but then they brought us one of each so we got to try them all Last on offer was a chocolate covered pretzel brought with a bottle of apple brandy  We were invited to have as much brandy as we wanted  Alas after that cocktail did I mention the cocktails are really good and a few excellent wines by the glass we only managed a few sips of the brandy with having to navigate LaGuardia airport in just a few short hours    And there was a parting gift  A glass container of granola to have for breakfast the following morning which I did and it was amazing  Did it live up to the hype  Definitely  Was it the best meal I have ever had  Certainly I would say this was the most flawless meal in terms of presentation quality and service I have experienced  Literally I cannot find anything to nit pick  The bathrooms were a little boring maybe  I would rate this as one of the top five dining experiences ever and it will certainly always be a memorable meal    I cant wait to come back for dinner  Bring on the apple brandy ',\n",
       " 'Had an incredible experience here We came for a late night reservation and were seated right away in a booth on the floor We did the 10 course menu that started with a cute box of black and white cookies They put a twist on it with a slightly tart and tangy flavor added and was a nice way to start off the meal It continued with a summer tomato theme with these dosas and a selection of dipping sauces and a tomato tea It was all very unique and savory This followed with a bowl of tiny tomatoes Im usually not a huge fan of whole tomatoes but this was cooked in a way that the flavor wasnt too overpowering For the third course they pushed out a tray with delicate corn soufflé and plated the dish table side and added caviar on top and bonito cream on the side I loved how it was slightly sweet and creamy from the corn but salty from the caviar and bonito  The next course we could choose and I went with the foie gras seared and it was absolutely amazing Again the flavor was very subtle but rich and nicely charred The next appetizer was lobster wrapped in a thin leaf while my boyfriend got the sea bass Immediately following was the snails course which was a lot of fun They pushed in a cart with a grill to continue cooking the snails kebab right in front of you When it was done you wrapped it in lettuce and can add 4 different types of sauces I really liked this one I love escargots and this was done in such a creative and delicious way They also came out with this complimentary bread with the most amazing butter that they offered to refill if you wanted   The mains took a while to come out  I got the duck and my boyfriend got the steak It came with two sides to share  a creamed corn and zucchini that were great on their own as well Even with all the small portion sizes we were getting pretty full by this point   The dessert courses started with this creme filled brioche that came with two savory dipping sauces We then both chose to get the chocolate sherbet desserts which were perfect Finally they ended up giving out this tier with two pretzels and a bottle of brandy which you could finish if you wanted to but that bottle was very very strong  I could only take one sip   To top off the amazing experience they gave us two goody bags with jars of granola and the menu in those cute case Overall a really well done and delicious meal ',\n",

       " 'Meal overall was disappointing given the threestar Michelin status Service was fine but nothing special Our waitress met the basic requirements for decent service but nothing above and beyond like I would expect at a restaurant of this caliber The foie gras dish was so bland my friend actually asked to return the dish for amazing foie gras visit The Musket Room We were surprised that there were no dishes that gave us the wow factor that we were anticipating There was nothing particularly inventive in any of the dishes which was especially disappointing given such exorbitant prices Only thing I appreciated was the prepaymentno tipping Yelps twostar description of Meh Ive experienced better perfectly sums up our experience ',\n",
       " 'Im struggling between giving this a 3 star or 4 star review Dont get me wrong its a really good restaurant and you will not be disappointed But I think most people come here to be blown away and it just wont happen The first dish the caviar soufflé was probably my favorite And they have really great bread Everything else was okay nothing to really rave about The duck was certainly interesting and tasty with the lavender and peppercorn crust but I had a hard time cutting it with my knife The veal was good but not super memorable Same with the lobster good but not great I think the scallop was my least favorite and the husband agreed salty and a little fishy And the chocolate dessert kind of sucked the pumpkin squash one is way better Also prepare for the pour of a 40 glass of Pinot noir to be light A good restaurant for sure but not my favorite I will be generous today ',\n",
       " 'The best restaurant in the world  according to San Pellegrino  fell short of the expectations one might have for a restaurant of its supposed caliber As has been noted already the food here was decent but not great simply done but simple to a fault   The good   The tasting menu is on the more affordable side of things at 300  for a 3 Michelin starred restaurant in a large metropolitan city thats a good deal   The truffle course  the caviar benedict course were good  The ambiance  decor of the restaurant were perfect  just the right combo of fancy  casual  The bad  Unfortunately most of the plates were just ok  For example the dry aged duck was tough and overcooked the greens dish was served on top of an unappetizing slice of rye custard aka a cold soggy piece of rye bread the mulled wine ice cream had ice flakes in it indicating that it was melted and then frozen again Etc   Plating was not entirely impressive which I imagine is partially due to simplicity of ingredients  I didnt walk out of the restaurant thinking that I had just eaten at the best restaurant in the world but I believe its unfair to hold any restaurant to such an impossible if not mythical standard Even so the quality of 11MP was not quite there even by regular standards I dont think Ill be back but Im glad I can cross this off my bucket list ',\n",
       " 'I took my best friend here for her birthday back in June when EMP was still number 1 on the top 50 restaurants list The two of us have been lucky to experience a number of other three Michelin start restaurants and we had both wanted to add this to place to the list While the food was executed beautifully the overall experience was underwhelming especially at that price point There wasnt one dish that made us say wow and leave a lasting impression The service was impeccable and almost over the top but as for the food felt that this was overhyped and dare I say a bit bland ',\n",

       " 'My dad saw that this restaurant was considered the best in the world so we had to come see for ourselves It was rather difficult to get a reservation at a decent time ie not at 10pm which seemed to be the only choice for weeks but I regularly checked the website and eventually found a reservation at 715pm for a Thursday night There was hardly any signage out front so finding the restaurant wasnt as easy as it should have been I was greeted immediately after going through the revolving doors and I took a seat near the host station and was given a glass of water while I waited for the rest of my party to arrive  We were seated near the front of the restaurant The table was large enough and the chairs were so comfortable The service here was impeccable as expected Our waters were constantly refilled crumbs brushed away and utensils replaced throughout the evening There were a lot of courses so I cant really remember exactly what we ate but Ill highlight some of the ones that stood out to me The corn was amazing The duck one of the main courses I believe was so delicious My brother raved about the caviar and my dad loved the steak The lobster was a little chewier than I would have preferred but still really good The snails were fun to eat They brought out a mini grill so we could finish grilling the snails ourselves It included 4 sauces that you can add and then they give you some lettuce to wrap the snails around Dessert was good too   I wish I could say this was the best dining experience Ive ever had but it wasnt Im not really sure what it was maybe my expectations were too high Everything was just fine but it was literally just that fine It didnt wow me like some other restaurants have and the food was delicious and presented very creatively but I dont think I would come back here because I dont think its worth the price tag ',\n",
       " 'This was my first time eating at a three star michelin rated restaurant and our group of three was very excited  The first course being served as a bunch of presents to open was definitely a fun christmas touch That course was really good too The potato pancake was awesome as well as the caviar   After that the presentation and  service both felt kind of like just going through the motions They even got one order wrong brook trout rather than the ordered pan seared foie gras   The poached lobster was not great Pretty average for lobster The halibut my sister ordered was amazing though   The truffle pizza and mushroom presentation was the last presentation that stood out for me They prepared the the truffle and thyme tart table side That was pretty cool and the mushrooms were pretty good    For the main coursethe crust on the duck was very interesting and tasty the duck itself was about average for duck I have eaten out at restaurants The venison my brother ordered was the best venison Ive ever had There were 2 side dishes brussels sprouts with sausage and garlic kale with a pickled egg yolk Both were very good   The cheddar apple tartlet was bland and not very interesting I was hoping for more from the cheese course Pretty much same with the dessert course The little chocolate covered pretzel bonus was better than the actual dessert course   The wine pairing was solid  Overall the meal was tasty and the service mostly excellent but it was still a bit disappointing from what I hoped the experience would be Perhaps my expectations were a bit too high due to the press this restaurant has received ',\n",
       " 'Came here last night with my husband as part of our babymoon Made reservations precisely on November 1 for last night and was excited that they would be able to accommodate our dietary restrictions This was our second michelin star restaurant experience having been to per se two years ago and this one was far more disappointing  At over 300 per person not including drinks I would have expected far more Service was very good and for the most part they were attentive but where I felt things were really lacking was the quality and taste of the food They do explain all the dishes to you in detail I was NOT blown away by even one dish as I expected to be from what had been previously been deemed the number 1 restaurant in the world The meal was about 9 courses but nothing was fabulous My husband described it best by saying he just felt very underwhelmed  The first course is cool because everything is wrapped as gifts I did enjoy my dessert however there was only one dessert and you were asked to choose between three I would have expected to be able to receive all three desserts again given the cost and reputation of this place I left wanting more and feeling overall disappointed  They do send you home with a bag a granola and a copy of your menu in cute little tins If youre looking for a nice meal where cost is no issue then try this place but do not expect to be blown out of the water We did NOT receive any opportunity or offer to meet the chef or have a kitchen tour as some other reviewers described It seems like they were better in years past and have made the experience much more mundane I would have enjoyed the picnic basket and chocolate surprises as they apparently used to do ',\n",
       " 'After looking forward to EMP the worlds best restaurant for a year I finally got a chance to visit with a few coworkers  EMP recently went through a massive renovation and was closed for a while and though Im not sure what it looked like before I can comment that the decor inside is not bright but not dim clean and fresh  Its not the overly fancy kind of decor youd expect from such a place in my opinion    Service was superb as it should be for a place with this kind of reputation  People were pulling out my chairs replacing napkins and always around    We started off with gift boxes around our table for 6 which was strange as I had expected real gifts and not food in them definitely a nice touch for the holiday season  Inside there were a few startersamuse bouche  Given the menu changes all the time here its probably not too valuable to go into detail about everything  The highlight of the starters was the caviar though I wasnt too big of a fan of the play on bagels and cream cheese thing they did  seemed a little cheap if I dare say  For some of your dishes you are given a choice of 13 options    Next I chose the cold foie gras layered in between cabbage Literally amazing  I had the tilefish after that which was very mustardy and kind of took away from the flavor of the flaky fish  There was then a presentation of a pumpkin which sounds weird but it was kind of cool  They opened it up in front of you and then took it away and served the most melt in your mouth pumpkin with a light broth    In between dishes we got an expensive bottle of wine and the sommelier did a really cool presentation where they basically melted off the neck of a wine bottle  would recommend this for anyone who feels bougie  Next was the most DELICIOUS piece of seared duck with Sichuan peppercorn ever  Favorite dish of the night  This rivals Momofuku Kos duck which was one of my favorites also  There were a few little side dishes and what not but nothing to call home about  We got a play on pretzels cheese and beer that I really wasnt a huge fan of but everyone else loved it  For dessert we all shared all the options except the cranberry one and they were all amazing especially the apple cider donut  At the end we also got chocolate pretzels  All in all a divine dining experience that everyone should absolutely do once but I would not quite say this was the most amazing meal or dining experience of my life I just wasnt blown away as I was expecting to be given EMPs rep but it was still a damn good meal ',\n",
       " 'We visited the restaurant in April of 2018 after reading that it had received the honor of number one restaurant in the world  We also saw a special about the resturant on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon  Let me start by saying Im not disappointed that we went but it didnt quite live up to the VERY high expectations I had for it in my mind  The dress for the restaurant is casual meaning that you dont have to get super fancy dressed up  I guess part of me wanted people to look more formal given the price of the restaurant  And that goes the same for the wait staff they are not too dressed either  There were many times throughout the meal that I felt uncomfortable with the way the staff was staring at us it made me feel uneasy  Of course the food was all good even though I didnt know what I was eating at times  We have been to restuarants all over the world and for this to have the title of the number one I just simply did not agree as I can think of a couple that I place about this one For us the best part of the experience was the dessert it was very creative and presented well ',\n",
       " 'The most wonderful dining experience from start to finish  Food becomes a part of the moment not just something to be consumed And of course everything is delicious Its restaurants like this that redefine what it means to dine finely and its definitely worthy of being called a threestar Michelin restaurant Id come to New York just to dine here   If you have not been definitely make this a part of your to do list with at least one other person You can experience this alone but the more the better in my opinion After all food is best when shared ',\n",

       " 'I really want to do justice to this amazing experience  I will attempt to remember and describe all dishes in great detail  Thanks to my husband for planning this once in a life time experience  Why 4 Stars   Food just simply wasnt as good as other top tier restaurants such as French Laundry Alinea and even Chez Panisse  For 300 per lunch without drinks you expect some mindblowing taste  I think it was a total of 12 courses  First came out some little savory cheese cookies and a delicious scallop broth   The broth was actually one of our favorite items  Very flavorful  Perfect salt level  Cookies were okay but I didnt eat them to save room for the main event    Scallop with sea urchin  delicious  We enjoyed this light and refreshing dish  I think there were some thin apple slices in it  It was an appropriate appetizer    Caviar  this is a take on Eggs Benedict with ham gelée hollandaise custard and sturgeon caviar  Oh and a poached egg  Very good  Nothing particularly special except the container is beautiful    Squid  this was good   again something youd have at any good sushi restaurant  Chopped up squid and horseradish and juniper   We enjoyed it    Foie gras  delicious   simple sear   But we were already starting to feel like the foods were too rich  I didnt finish this item because I knew I couldnt get through the rest of the courses    Lobster  good  A few classic bites that are butter poached    Halibut  I thought this was better than the lobster   The cabbage on the side was awesome warming and perfectly seasoned  The turnip on top was very flavorful and perfectly shaped like little fish scales    Mushroom Tart  delicious broth and i loved the mushrooms   But at this point were getting full and even though they put probably 400 worth of truffles on our food its like  whats the point  They tasted earthy but thats about it  Just some dry truffle shavings on a cracker  didnt do it for me      Venison  this is a take on a Beef Wellington and again while good nothing to write home about  More foie gras  Actually getting tired of foie gras and truffles at this point  How is that even possible  Duck with Cabbage   this is actually featured in the Eleven cookbook  its a beauty with lavender and Szechuan peppercorns on top  They went a bit too far with the dryroasted seasonings on top I think   I dont really want to be biting through whole peppercorns and such but it does look nice  Is it the best duck Ive ever had  No    Trip to the kitchen   so apparently if you ask you can visit the kitchen and see the amazing working they do back there  plus they make you a great bite with more black truffle made into a mousse and piped into a cornet  Kind of like the cone that they have at French Laundry  I guess this is an homage to that  Its okay but I didnt bother finishing it  Too full and the black truffles were not flavorful no offense    Tubby cheese   at this point were sick of eating so I dont even remember this  I think it was good  It came with a mediocre dressed salad    Chocolate Tuile with Creme Fraiche ice cream  good  Dont know what else to say    Pear Cranberry Donut with Mulled Wine Ice cream  okay so this donut is AWFUL  I dont know who came up with this weird sour donut but its gross  but the ice cream on the side is delicious  I dont even like or eat dessert and I could bathe in this stuff man  Apple Brandy and pretzel chocolates   oh so they bring you a whole bottle of brandy at the end and you can stay and drink as much as you like  I did my part and had two shots  Overall  not the best restaurant in the world in terms of taste or ambiance  Service is great  But for the money I think next time Id rather do a Le Bernadin or Per Se    It was a fun experience but was it worth 700 for two people   ehhhh ',\n",

       " 'I have been super excited to try EMP especially after the new renovations Unfortunately here is my honest review of the place  Before I even go into the details let me start by saying this is indeed an amazing restaurant But if it is deemed the best of the best then I will hold it by those standards It did fall short of those expectations and as such Im giving it a 3 star rating It may be harsh but youre spending a significant amount for an incredible experience so you have to be better than just better than the next guy  Pros  Even before you get to the restaurant someone personally reaches out to you to make sure everything is perfect Its a great personal touch   There were some great dishes the lobster bisque sauce was perfect The pretzel was amazing I also really enjoyed the veal   The staff is very friendly and mostly attentive   The kitchen tour was a nice touch especially to show off the new set up  Cons  The dinner is too long I believe it was purposely done as to not make you feel rushed but the courses had 30 minute gaps in some places We had a 615 start and didnt finish until around 1020   The dishes were good but not amazing I cant honestly say any one dish blew me away   At one point one of the servers spilled my wine glass on me Now this wasnt a big deal on its own as mistakes happen It was more of how it was handled that was a bit upsetting for a restaurant of this caliber So after she spilled the wine on my jacket she picked up the glass and placed it back on my table She apologized and handed me a towel  Another member of the waitstaff also came over to help clean up and hand me additional towels All great until I look up and see my empty and sticky wine glass sitting on the table Im not expecting a freebie but Ive been to much lesser restaurants where they would come back with a new glass at least At the end I had to ask for a new one myself Normally not a huge deal but if youre the best restaurant in the world  Overall EMP is a great dining establishment and anyone would be lucky to go I am harsher on my critique as I expected to be blown away and was not   Either way congrats on the new renovations and thank you for the great night ',\n",
       " 'I hesitated slightly in giving this a 1 or 2 stars after all it has 3 michelin stars so who am I to judge  But that said I have dined at almost ten 3 michelin starred restaurants and several 2 and 1 starred restaurantsand this one barely deserves 1 star when compared to my experiences  There are plenty of other 3starred restaurants in NYC that are far superior than this one  So for a price tag of about 400pp after taxes and beverages go elsewhere  If you dont want to read the whole review let me illustrate it in a few senctences  My husband is a huge lover of cheese and he was starving by the time we arrived for dinner  Near the end there was a cheese course  Not only did I think it was gross but my hungry cheeseloving husband couldnt even finish it  And no the waiters did not ask if there was something wrong nor was a replacement offered  Now let me break this down  1 Service pretty standard 3 michelin quality service  Attentive and meticulous  But do they go above of and beyond  No  We came a week after our wedding and they were aware of this  We had just finished a trip to Napa and perhaps we had been spoiled but nearly every place we went they somehow acknowledged this point with a complimentary toast or small dessert or even a congratulatory note in the end  Now if you go somewhere and say its your birthday or anniversary or honeymoon i dont expect every restaurant to do something special but hey my standards are high when the price tag calls for perfection  Another point there were definitely gaps between dishes when we had nothing in front of us  We werent eating too fast  The couple next to us experienced the same thing  No not when I am paying for perfection I dont expect to wait 10 minutes between courses   2 Food taste the flavors were all over the place but overall uninteresting and bland   And they have some sort of obsession with radishes  They might be going for some theme but there was definitely some pickled radish or sour pickled vegetable on 3 straight dishes  Wheres the variety in flavor and texture  3 Food presentation this is where it all falls apart to the point of zero stars to the point of utter disappointment  With the exception of perhaps the first 2 and last courses the colors were very white and single toned  The presentation was also very boring  Again standards are higher for a 3 michelin star affair and one always eats with their eyes before their mouths  And i could barely swallow at the appearance of some of the dishes  White on white yells i dont care about this dish  4 Ambiance and decor average  Overall nice with high ceilings  However the corner cushioned seats we sat in were dirtied with crumbs I wonder if the prior patrons had left some crumbs  But again this lack of attention to details is quite upsetting  Who wants to skooch into a seat only to discover your sitting on gritty crumbs   5 Last note They come with a wonderful presentation of a baked Alaska for dessert  The torching is on an 8 inch diameter dessert  They then take it away to prepare the dessert for youwhen they return you get a piece the size of a halfdollar coin  Wheres the rest of my baked Alaska  Also my husband feels a similar shrinkage in size occurred with the lobster dish but I thought maybe the crustacean naturally shrinks after cookingwho knows  Seriously I have never felt that my money went to waste when Ive dined at a 3 Michelin star restaurant but here I felt gypped ',\n",
       " 'I wont add to all the welldeserved kudos dining there was an ethereal experience  I simply wanted to comment on the wine flights  They come in the 170 and the 350 ranges so my wife and I tried one of each  The 170 version did not offer much that was special and while the 350 version had a couple of extraordinary things on it a perfectly balanced Sauternes a 2004 Châteauneuf and a wonderfully weird thick sherry from Andalucia it was disappointing  To begin you are given more white than red wine Im a red drinker mainly and lots of champagne at the beginning a wine Ive never quite seen the point of so sue me  Moreover since we were there early at 6 many of the bottles were just opened and took time to develop in the glass and since youre only getting a few sips your experience with the best of each one is limited  This was especially true of the ChassagneMontrachet which only tasted like the wonderful wine I know in the last sip  Perhaps it would be a good idea to uncork some bottles early and let them breathe a little in the bottle  In any case if you know something about wine and rely on the wait staff which knows them well you are probably better off getting your own bottle or two halfbottles For 500  you could really indulge in something special ',\n",

       " 'After 4 years of living in New York and countless restaurant experiences that ranged from the good to the bad to the ugly I finally decided to join Yelp after eating at Eleven Madison Park  While I dont consider myself a foodie by any means I do get to eat at the fancier NYC restaurants by virtue of my job so Id like to think Im not a total rube  I read a lot of reviews prior to going to EMP to get a better idea of what to expect and I have to assume there is a certain degree of confirmation bias involved when reflecting on a meal that cost upwards of 500 pp because no one wants to admit that they spent a fortune on an unremarkable experience  EMP was certainly an experience unlike any Ive ever had but when it comes down to it the food was not outstanding and I hate to say it disappointing  Leaving I couldnt name a single dish that wowed me or that left me wanting to come back  This also may be colored by the fact that the waitstaff gave me the same feeling I get when Im followed around a store fellow people of color will know what I mean and Im also pretty sure I got food poisoning but more on that later  THE GOOD The day before our reservation the restaurant reached out to ask if we were celebrating anything special  We didnt respond but did share what we were celebrating and got a very cute gift related to that after our meal  All of the waitstaff was super knowledgable and attentive and answered silly questions we had about the MetLife building and what was going on at other tables  The highlight of our night was watching the waitstaff very capably escort out a table of very drunk patrons  The wine pairing was very very good with flavors that coordinated remarkably with the food  The decor and ambiance is very pretty  The wine pours are heavy I didnt drink much but definitely understood how that table got so drunk  Plus the last course comes with a bottle of apple brandy to drink to your hearts desire  THE BAD I dont know if we looked less affluent than the other guests or perhaps more brown but every time we asked a question about what was going on at another table the servers acted like we were trying to scam our way into getting something for free  Just expressing some curiosity You would too if you saw the crazy stuff going on around the dining room   The food seemed targeted at a nonNYC audience with kitschy dishes like a savory black and white cookie and a play on a lox bagel in the form of a cheesecake served with caviar  Im not a fan of touristy experiences but if you are this may be a pro  While the dishes all had unique flavors some were outright bland  The fluke and bass for example were really lacking in the flavor department  You leave with a printed out menu and some EMP granola  The next morning I felt a little funny and ate some granola thinking I was just hungry  I then had some pretty bad stomach issues and since everything I ate in the prior 12 hours was from EMP Im pretty sure it was something I ate  Although I did have wine I didnt drink very much and left the dinner sober so it was not a hangover  Overall if EMP is on your bucket list for the experience you should go  But if youre more concerned with food than theatre when you eat   you can get a better meal at a peer or even less prestigious restaurant  I also cant shake the feeling of being othered so if youre a POC I hope you leave feeling differently but heres some fair warning that you may be looked at sideways ',\n",

       " 'KenScale 9010  Recently I got engaged to my girlfriend We chose her ring together but I wanted to pop the question when she didnt expect it In the course of my planning for the engagement ceremony I thought about which restaurant I should take her to after I propose to her As someone who has been living in New York City for close to 11 years she has been to many restaurants in the city I somehow remembered though that she said she hadnt been to Eleven Madison Park yet and also knowing that the restaurant is shutting down for renovations in the summer I knew this was the perfect venue to have an engagement dinner I had an unbelievable meal on my visit a couple of years ago where the creativity of dishes combined with careful execution and commitment to fresh ingredients really showed why EMP is one of the best restaurants in the world How did our engagement dinner stack up against my previous visit The menu has gotten shorter more like 810 compared to close to 20 last time and the dishes have become somewhat more predictable no more asparagus cooked inside a cow bladder but we still had an amazing meal  After a celebratory champagne we were served with an assortment of bites Among those my favorite was celery root with black truffle and parsnip pie and my girlfriend also enjoyed rutabaga with celery and walnuts Just like last time the restaurant served caviar in a playful take on eggs benedict it was still as amazing as I had remembered with the combination of caviar diced ham and pickled egg yolk displaying so much wonderful complexity in flavor For the starter course I went with foie gras seared with maple and apple while my girlfriend went to scallop marinated with leek and potato Foie gras had silky smooth texture that I very much enjoyed even though Im not really a foie gras person and a bite of scallop that I stole from my girlfriend also had elegant balance of texture One of the best dishes during our meal was the lobster After the servers brought forward a long rectangular pan where the lobster was being smoked and steamed we got to taste an amazingly chewy piece of lobster that I marveled at what kind of trick the kitchen pulled to achieve this textural excellence The vegetable dishes that followed were also outstanding I was more partial to the squash roasted with bone marrow and pumpkin seeds for the way the squash really just melted in my mouth but sweet potato smoked with mustard seeds and apple wasnt far behind in deliciousness For the main dish we both ordered the magnificently cooked duck glazed in honey and lavender and accompanied by onion and plum My girlfriend who is very partial to duck meat absolutely enjoyed this beautiful piece of meat which was even better with the side dishes of brussels sprouts and parsnip The weakest part of the meal was in the cheese course I just wish the kitchen put together fondue in its standard format instead of putting it inside baked potato that quickly overwhelmed the cheeses flavor The desserts that came after however were much better I could have the delightful apple poached with buckwheat toffee cake and apple sorbet every day for its elegant flavor without being too sweet and chestnut cheesecake with sweet potato custard and chestnut honey ice cream was also quite delicious The meal ended with a little game where we got to match four different varieties of chocolate with four different animals from which the taste of chocolate came from Unfortunately we only got one right  I didnt realize until I booked the table for our engagement that EMP has switched to a ticket system similar to how other fine dining restaurants like Alinea in Chicago do these days In other words you pay up front for your meal so make sure to find a commitable date that you can book We both really enjoyed a fine cabernet bottle from Napa where we are actually planning to have a wedding too to complement our meal Services at EMP were still as outstanding as I remembered it Im really glad that our engagement dinner was a memorable evening with awesome food wine and services Let KenScales culinary journey continue this time with soon to be my life partner ',\n",

       " 'I came to EMP on my first trip to NYC to celebrate many occasions two birthdays and an anniversary to be exact We had been following the remodel of EMP and were really looking forward to our meal We left very satiated with no regrets   The ultimate takeaway of our experience was that for the cost it was worth it but only for a nice occasion Would I necessarily be able to justify the high cost for just an average night  absolutely not And for the high cost was everything done impeccably Close but not quite Ive had equally great food at a lower price point eg 150 pp vs 300 pp but where EMP really sets itself above the rest is service There was never a moment that we felt forgotten about Napkins were folded surfaces cleaned shawls were delivered for us perpetually shivering ladies and tablecloths were ironed literally In terms of the food at that cost and at 3 Michelin stars I really expected to be WOWd by every single dish Unfortunately this was just not the case   STANDOUTS   Starter bites compressed apples dipped in foie gras caramel with apple almond crumble Who would have known that tart apple and the sweetness of the caramel could be so well complimented by smooth and rich foie gras   Smoked sturgeon cheesecake with caviar this one was communally served and an absolute showstopper it tasted like an ultra luxurious bagel with lox and looked a million bucks Could have taken it without the pickled cucumbers   Seared warm foie gras dish with beets This course was presented with various other options clams with fennel mushroom carpaccio or the cold foie gras preparation with cabbage I ended up choosing the clams but this to me was the CLEAR winner I would try to explain all the components of the dish but frankly I am not sure aside from the beets there was a crunch component and it was just indescribable This is hands down one of the best things Ive ever tasted   Roasted duck with honey and lavender beautiful and impeccably executed from head to toe The duck with succulent and juicy and the crusted skin with salt and honey provided just the right amount of texture to the dish   COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT  Starter bites sweet potato tart They compared it to a sweet potato pie when describing to us but honestly it was a very sad black sheep version I feel like there are so many better things that can be done with a sweet potato   Clams with fennel while visually beautiful and labor intensive I just found the taste to be one note surfer clams with clam mouse and dill It felt like it was missing something and it was not the most pleasing texture   Kale seasonal side with egg yolk There was something underneath the kale perhaps a kale puree that was a very deep green color with a bitter taste and displeasing texture Honestly I wasnt sure what it was and it was the only thing we ate all night that was left on the plate   Wine pairings Unfortunately we were not impressed by a majority of the pairings chosen and would probably do without this the next time around   For the experience as a whole food service kitchen tour we had a great night But for the overall bill it just felt like there were certain areas that could have been improved For 300 a person I think the kabocha squash course and cheddar with pretzel and beer could be improvedelevated lovely just not something I would expect at this pricepoint However the personalization and take home gifts were certainly nice touches and I would absolutely recommend EMP to everyone looking to have a nice night out ',\n",

       " 'What a disappointment Seeing so many great reviews maybe we just had really bad luck and hit them on an especially off night but based on our most recent experience about a week ago definitely do not understand the hype or the ratings and it really makes us question the value of Michelin stars We have dined here several times in the past prior to the recent renovation and always had a wonderful experience It used to be fun the food was great and you never felt the time pass as you enjoyed a great meal with great service This latest meal was almost torturous We are used to fine dining and understand long meals but whether it be here in the past or other restaurants along the lines of Jean Georges or Daniel as a couple of examples they have always been seamless experiences where you never feel like you are being left waiting or worse ignored That was the case during our most recent evening at EMP There was no interaction with the staff beyond the bare minimum obligatory exchanges Long stretches of time would pass between courses when no one would even look our way much less come by our table When we finally got someones attention and commented on the long wait for the next course she sheepishly acknowledged that they had just changed menus and the kitchen was a little off Even getting a glass of wine took forever From the time it was ordered to when someone else put a glass on the table to when someone else brought the bottle to a serving station near us to when someone else finally poured it took about a half hour The staff while very polite and efficient seemed almost robotic and there appeared to be no adult in charge You would think that after our comment about waiting so long someone in a managerial position might stop by to apologize or at least acknowledge It was just two of us a married couple and while we like each other well enough it was ridiculous how long we were left just idly sitting around waiting for food and drink The meal took almost four hours As for the food it was fine But I would not put it in the exceptional category that warrants the price paid or in comparison to other restaurants in this range and I would not be able to honestly tell anyone that it is worth the high price or giving up an evening for ',\n",

       " 'So this restaurant is definitely up there in my top restaurants but I would by no means call it 1  The first bite was a cross between a miniature black and white cookie and a ritz cracker cheese sandwich nothing special to be honest The scallop course next with live diver scallop and sea urchin was wonderful so fresh and light with the uni not overpowering the dish at all And it worked so well with the sparkling pinot from Burgundy The bread and broth with scallop infused butter on the side was another meh for me The sparkling pinot also worked well with the next dish the play on eggs benedict with sturgeon caviar A solid dish highlighted by the smoked ham with the caviar for me they also provided miniature buns so you could create an egg mcmuffin sandwich of your own very fun Then they invited me back to the kitchen very similar to the French Laundry and such a nice touch There they prepared another bite in front of me chimney bread with black truffles done in a relish cream and a garnish Again a great touch but it made me uncomfortable When I eat something wonderful I like to eat slowly chew thoughtfully and breathe a little close my eyes its all very personal And here I am standing at the station with people all around me and the server waiting to escort me back to my table and honestly I couldnt really enjoy the dish  Back at my table the next course was a definite wow for me hudson valley foie gras with ginger maple and pickled apple paired with an amazing Cadillac similar to a sauternes I dont think Ive ever taken as long to eat anything in my life just couldnt bare to end it The foie gras was perfect and the balance of the crisp pickled apple and the sweetness of the maple along with the Cadillac was justI will be dreaming about this dish for quite awhile The butterpoached lobster was next and honestly the whole dish fell flat for me I couldnt get past how chewy the lobster was for one and the butternut squash and chestnut and kale just didnt add any warmth to me they really didnt add much at all though the sauce that was plated with it was delicious Also Im not a big fan of Chablis to begin with and it was too bright and metallic for the dish I thought The mushroom tart was a tableside presentation and beautifully done not to mention all the black truffle they shave over the crisp top Over the top Perhaps but I loved it as someone who will never tire of all the truffle In general though I love mushrooms and this very pure mushroom dish was another highlight for me I was excited about the Cabernet Franc from the Loire region as well also as someone who loves VirginiaMaryland Cab Franc It was definitely WAY more tannic than I was expecting and not something I could drink alone but it did pair wonderfully with mushrooms and really brought out the funk in a good way The duck dish wasdisappointing but not because of the flavors I love dryaging and the peppercorn and lavender crust was mindblowingly good But When the dish came out the first time the duck was a bit welldone for my liking and after I had talked to my server about the lobster they told me to please let them know if I wanted anything done differently and they were very sweet about it So I had them take it back and the duck that came back out was seared on top but raw the rest of the way which was perfect for the thinner end of the cut But once I got up to the thickest part I honestly had to cut away some of the uncooked part because it was just too raw for me and I felt really bad having them take it back a second time It was honestly a little frustrating to know just how amazing this dish would have been if the duck was cooked properly throughout maybe not have such a variation of thickness within the cut to keep from the inconsistent cooking Overlooking that the potato and the leek dumplings were good and the 2005 Nebbiolo from Piedmont was perfect with this dish Ive never had a more divinesmelling wine too just smelling the beautiful mix of earthy cherry and floral lavender easily passed the time while I was waiting for the duck  It was fun to get a completely different preparation of a Nebbiolo from 2016 to compare with the last glass for the cheese course The alpine cheese with celery root was wonderful and worked so well with this sweeter more acidic Nebbiolo The winter greens tossed in a black truffle dressing were a throw away for sure though and added nothing to the dish Another oh wow was the pumpkin cake with bruleed butternut squash butternut squash and yuzu ice cream with sarsaparilla Such an amazing blend of gentle sweetness salty and savory and then the acid of the yuzu just cuts it so well The sweet Ramandolo complimented every bite especially since the dessert itself was not very sweet to begin with Another really slow eat as I hated to finish the dish AND Yelp apparently has a character limit ',\n",

       " 'So this is the fourth 3 Michelin Star restaurant weve tried in the past two years for dinner Im counting Daniel since it was a 3Star prior to this years demotion Have to say Eleven Madison Park is not on top of the list in comparison to Per Se JeanGeorges or Daniel  We were a party of five seated at probably the best table in the restaurant in terms of its location within the place First thing I noticed very casual dress code I inquired there wasnt one Probably wouldnt have dined there had I known I was going to be sitting across eyeview of people in their shortsleeved bowling shirts The place was at a fantastic physical location however with views of Madison Square Park and wide windows Even the entrance felt majestic  But inside it didnt feel exclusive People spoke and laughed loudly  Bar was well in view and I found that to be quite uncomfortable as well  I liked the decor but then again it was catered to this casual setting which I didnt expect  EVERY person from the moment you entered the restaurant to the moment we left was friendly knowledgeable and willing to answer and assist with anything we needed  So dont blame the staff they did what they were asked to deliver  We were introduced by Steven with the crux of our evening He was a friendly gent and expertly knew the answers to any of our questions Started with a small ribboned box and five cookies inside then a stacked tray of what looked to me like steamed dumpling trays which turned out to be starters intended to wet our palates  All dishes to follow were unique I especially love the detail flowers in some of the dishes which not only added to the presentation but mostly to the flavor Lavender duck unfortunately paled in comparison to the duck at Per Se  Baked Alaska at the end of the meal what happened to the rest of it  I loved the potatoes whether creamed au gratin or simply scooped and shaped they were very flavorful  I would say the dish with caviar and kernels of corn was my favorite dish  I want to mention the dish with the asparagus steamed inside the pigs bladder  Not the most pleasant aroma while this was happening in front of us since there is nothing like hot animal bladder air being blown my way to conjure up my appetite  Asparagus however was probably the most tender and flavorful asparagus I have ever had  We were given a chocolate tasting game before desert This game provided four types of chocolate and we had to match the milk used for each whether it was from a cow a bison a lamb or a goat  Im very proud to say that I was the only one at my table with all four correctly matched answers  But what was my prize  There wasnt  End of the evening we were all given a glass container filled with trail mix and the same tin container the caviar came in with our menu inside  The menu was not customized so we each had the entire menu and not what we selected as souvenir Yes the date was on there but just like the dress code I was left a bit uneasy  Gratuity not accepted  OK that sure didnt sat well with me  Wanted to show my appreciation to the staff but the opportunity was not available  One thing that really turned me off was a select few were given the tour of the kitchen we werent  What was the selection process  It appeared random  Well we were not given a tour and that pretty much cinched the 3star rating here for me  If youd ordered a bottle of wine prior to some particular date which I stopped paying attention to youd get this contraption where they literally cut off a section of the bottle neck since the cork is too dried up to be pulled  Again theyll wheel out a table where they need to showcase their advance pyro technique to literally melt the neck off the wine bottle  Pigs bladder Baked Alaska and this wine opening thing at time it seems this was more of a circus act than fine dining  Listen I am very particular I sometimes pay more attention to the little things and not the main elements  Well I strongly believe the little things are at times more memorable than the obvious thats just me  I dont think I would return to Eleven Madison Park simply because if someone asks me which 3 Michelin Star restaurants in NYC I would I recommend the answer would be Ive only been to four and so far my favorite is Per Se  Were looking to try Le Bernardin and Masa later this year and that will conclude our list of the current 3 Michelin Star restaurants in NYC  No I didnt forget Chefs Table its in Brooklyn not my thing no offense to Brooklyn  Will gladly await its Manhattan opening in 2017 ',\n",

       " 'Its been 2 12 years since weve been to EMP so this review comes a bit late and in the midst of some substantial changes to the menu from what I understand But even years later EMP remains my GOAT  my favorite restaurant and favorite meal of all time  EMP has plenty of company in New York when it comes to worldrenowned restaurants that focus on service as much as they do food If you like to count Michelin stars Le Bernardin Jean Georges and Per Se all excel at this But the reason I place EMP so squarely and unquestionably above the rest is how much of an experience the entire meal is from before you walk in the door to when you walk out  There is clearly a great deal of effort that goes into this experience but it all seems so effortless when you see it in motion Youre aware of the large staff they have on hand but theyre never intrusive and never hover At the same time you are never ignored  I was taking much longer than normal on a course my own fault and was eventually asked if everything was okay with the dish  a nice reminder that they are paying careful attention  The environment and feel at EMP is noticeably younger than at its counterparts in the city and the age of our fellow diners reflected that most people looked in their 20s30s Its not a casual place by any means the people using old fashioned irons on the tablecloths at empty tables will remind you of that but the atmosphere is more friendly and doesnt feel stuffy in the slightest They really hit the sweet spot here in making sure you feel comfortable throughout the entire meal  And then theres the food EMP Is priced similarly to its competitors and the meal took roughly the same amount of time about 3 hours But at 16 courses the meal just blows everything else out of the water They could have easily done half of these courses with larger portions and this meal would still stand up to the others These are 16 well planned well executed creative dishes that at times have an element of fun to them  we were treated to a sort of ode to New York starting with a savory black and white cookie and ending with a sweet one  I could go on and on about each of these dishes but my opinion boils down to this  EMP belongs on every foodies bucket list Not sure how the new format turned out but I plan on finding out soon ',\n",

       " 'I really cant say enough bad things about the food at Eleven Madison Park  I took my Dad and his wife here for lunch and we all had a horrible meal    I really dont care how many times you wish my Dad happy birthday or how often you refill my water or take me on a tour of the kitchen or give me a goody bag  Thats all schtick  All I want is a good tasting meal and we did not get that at Eleven Madison Park   What was very surprising was that I didnt like ANY of the courses until the duck arrived which is sort of the main course of the meal  Yes the duck was good but the prior 6 courses I would label as disgusting  It got to the point where I needed to visit the bathroom to walk around and cool down because I couldnt believe that I could dislike everything being served  I even told my family that I would pay the restaurant not to serve some of those courses   It seems to me that they took foods that naturally would have tasted delicious but instead added all these flavor combinations which ended up making delicious things disgusting  One course had apple slices that were soaked in vinegar so your brain thinks youre eating apple but it tasted so bad  Another course the lobster which we all know is normally a delicious food they prepare it in such a way that you would have to put tremendous effort to make lobster taste poorly and thats precisely what they did   Hey look Im probably the only person this has happened to at Eleven Madison Park and everyone else can sing its praises forever but if you offered me a free meal to go back there I wouldnt take you up on that offer ',\n",

       " 'We came here on a very cold early afternoon yesterday I was surprised how easily I got a reservation here for 1 PM on a Saturday but I digress The space of the restaurant was expansive and more oldworld styled The service was excellent as expected in most fine dining restaurants I appreciated the fact that some sauces and food was prepared or finished table side   The memorable dishes for me were the pan seared foie gras which I would rate a 10 of 10 I have had foie gras in the past but nothing so rich and so quick to dissolve in the mouth like this foie gras The accoutrements with the foie gras also paired nicely with the richness of this sliver of goodness The second memorable dish was the Lobster Newberg whose sauce was prepared table side our hostess stressed very much how the dish used to be named Lobster à la Wenberg Anyways the sauce was prepared with the innards of a lobster head apple brandy herbs and a kind of lobster bisque The lobster itself was perfectly poached and was brought in separately as the sauce was poured on top of it the micro mushrooms complimented the dish nicely   The third memorable dish was the smoked sturgeon dish with its various side platings all very beautifully arranged and almost overwhelming These complemented flavors included a slice of bread with ethereal thinness caviar with crème fraîche pickled mackerel whitefish potato salad pickled cucumbers with black rye and salmon and beets with apple and trout roe Each section had its own distinct flavor and the thought process was executed well in this set of dishes   That being said I want to explain why I gave this restaurant only a 4 star rating It was not because of service or the environment it was the remainder of the dishes most notably the duck I expected a godly piece of poultry but I found it much more ordinary than what my expectation believed it to be The knife given to us was dull and the skin with the flesh wasnt very forgiving to the knife so I was initially shocked that my knife couldnt even penetrate the duck after 45 strokes The skin was flavored well but not as crispy as I had imagined the flesh was more tough than tender The mushrooms were cooked nicely but I wasnt a fan of the thick mushroom mousse that accompanied the duck breast Maybe this was an off day I am not entirely sure   Was this a 3 star michelin meal to me Probably not but what do I know Ive been to many restaurants but this meal didnt blow me away Not to say it wasnt good but it did not exactly match my expectations as very few restaurants actually do Would I try Eleven Madison Park again Yes perhaps for a summer menu when other produce is available many of these dishes were root based and perhaps the better weather in the surrounding area will in turn translate to better dishes for my palate Perhaps but the next stop on our list is Le Bernardin  Thank you for reading this review ',\n",

       " 'My EMP review is loong overdue but I will be returning there next week and the anticipation stirred up all the memories of delicious food  I have been lucky enough to dine at EMP 3 times and each time I left in awe of the quality of service and the stream of insanely perfect dishes I received    The first time I went waaay back in 2013 it was my first 3star Michelin experience and they had recently updated the menu to the current New Yorkthemed presentation  I really thought i had died and gone to foodie heaven  Each dish was more amazing than the next and the staff made us feel extra special without being overbearing  I am a huge meat eater but the carrot tartare is one of my favorite restaurant dishes of all times  It was so simple yet so complex and fun to make  We had opted for lamb that night and with the bread they brought two types of butter one made with the lamb renderings  Ohhhh myyyy gawwwd that lamb rendering butter put every other butter to shame and beats out the duck fat and steak version also so served by EMP  It wasnt until my third visit that I tried the lavender and fennel crusted duck and definitely lived up to the hype  so tender so flavorful and just the right balance of floral notes from the lavender and bite from the fennel  I normally dont like floral flavours in my food hence why my hesitation to initially order it but wow it was good  My third visit may have also been my favorite  We were there for my mothers birthday and they treated us like royalty making sure our every need was taken care of and doing extra things to make us feel special    Since my first visit Ive been to a number of the other 3star NYC restaurants and EMP remains my favourite  Why  Because they create an atmosphere where a 45 hour dinner feels like a fleeting hour of just amazing food and fun  There is no stuffiness or air pretentiousness here  If you look around every one is having a good time including the staff  No one blinks twice if you ask them what an ingredient is or how something is prepared  You just dont get that at a lot of high end restaurants here I can only hope my next visit will be just as on point as the rest and EMP will continue to be one of my favorite dining experiences in the world ',\n",

       " 'It was supposed to be my foodie dream come true I waited and waited for a very special occasion to finally come to EMP After 8 years in the city it was actually happening I matched to my dream residency and my fiancé surprised me on the same morning while I was still in tears with the reservation When he asked me if I wanted to go I teased him that we needed to make a reservation 28 days in advance and we cant just walk in  he then told me he actually made one while we were still in Canada Yep Im marrying this one   We were warned to save our belly by friends and were told actual dinner would last up to 4 hrs We arrived promptly for our reservation and were seated immediately They then presented us an envelop where we were to select an ingredient to be incorporated in our tasting menu My fiancé went with maple and I went with cranberry Then our food journey begin   Blackwhite savory cookie  tasted just like Ritz cheese crackers  Oysters  really bland lemon and cocktail sauce might actually taste better  Scallop  the apple sorbet was so overpowering could have put anything under and I wouldnt know what I was eating  Beef  actual bone with stuffed tartare Tasty but not memorable  Pastrami  made my own open face sandwich a waste of a course to be honest Paired with maple and cranberry soda  both screamed diabetes   Foie gras  our waiter actually forgot that one of us wanted it seared When my fiancé and I grabbed his attention and asked since our dishes looked exactly the same and we actually didnt know what seared one was supposed to look like  our waiter thought that I was being difficult and changed my mind  he kinda just rambled on how he thought he established that we both wanted cold which wasnt true and just ended the misunderstanding with an extra order of seared foie gras for my fiancé and I to share He never actually acknowledged his mistake and it seemed our convo was cut short But I guess I cant complain about free foie gras Cold foie gras  again really plain and couldnt tell for my life what I was eating Seared much better  especially when I smother a thick cut of it on top of their house made bread But it wasnt anything special  Asiates had this beat hands down  Apple  a bit too sour but made Bleu cheese tasted ok I hate Bleu cheese  Lobster  the lobsters were so overcooked It almost flew out of my plate when I was sawing it  Celery root  1 of the better dishes of the night and it was the truffle mushroom cream not the celery root itself  Duck  We chose the duck over the pork for our main course started us off with duck broth and a cracker with foie gras and cheese Both a treat The duck broth had a layer of oil but the taste was light and flavorful Main dish  Even though I loved the herb seasoning on top of the skin my duck was cold and the meat was tough This was supposed to be the star of my tasting The side cup of foie gras pudding was really rich and flavorful  I enjoyed dipping more bread into it but straight up spooning and eating it would be impossible   Greensward  presented in a whimsical picnic basket  sparking cider  fruit cake  onion jam Not enough pretzel to go with all the pairing When I asked and waited for a second serving of pretzel another waiter came by and was ready to clear the table When he learned that we were waiting for more bread and he seemed really surprised o really Yes I know we are more than half way in in our tasting and I stuffed my face with 6 rolls But there are 45 of the cheese jam and fruitcake left and I will eat   Sweet potato  should have named this espresso because the taste of the espresso meringue overpower everything else  Baked Alaska  beautiful lighting presentation by the table They incorporated the maple and cranberry that we chose in the beginning of the tasting by splashing a bit of the maple cream and cranberry sauce onto the dish The rum cream again overpowered everything else The maple tasted like a shot of caramel sauce   Chocolate pretzel  black and white sweet cookies  can probably find these in Walgreen and have handful of them all to myself  Service was acceptable but felt a bit ignored I had to struggle getting in and out of my seat perhaps it was because the 3 tables around us all got wine pairing They gifted us a jar of housemade granola and a box of peanut butter chocolate with a slip of Congratz to go A nice touch but we saw every table got one Taste wise  My fiancé and I expected so much more a Michelin 3 stars Nothing was memorable There wasnt a moment where I took a bite my eyes lit up grabbed my fiancés hands and said omg u have to try this Sad to say but we had better food in the city during Restaurant Week It was a reservation that Ive always dreamed of but only to learned that the dream was much better than reality ',\n",
       " 'My friends and I have a tradition of celebrating New Years Eve with a dinner at an acclaimed and Michelin starred restaurant I went into Eleven Madison Park expecting to have my taste buds spoiled and my mind blown especially since my previous New Years Eve dinners at Jean George and Bouley were spectacular but I ended the meal feeling completely underwhelmed The highlights of the meal were the play on Eggs Benedict with caviar which was buttery and whimsical and the Foie Gras was smooth and savory at first bite and then left your tongue with a sweet aftertaste Unfortunately the low was the main course The menu listed Venison which I dont eat The waitress was kind enough to make a substitution of either a vegetarian option or fish I selected the fish and I now wished I went with the vegetarian option or just kept the venison The halibut was served lukewarm to cold and lacked flavor All I tasted was salt and too much of it It was accompanied by a glazed beet that was just ok The dessert which was custard with bee pollen ice cream that hid a small ball of honey It was nice but nothing to rave about    Overall the atmosphere was lovely and the waitstaff was courteous and friendly the meal just left me disappointed especially for the amount that you are paying  300  However I am happy that I tried Eleven Madison Park it was definitely on my restaurant bucket list and I am happier to cross it off my list and leave at that ',\n",

       " 'My 400th review goes to Eleven Madison Park I really wish I could give EMP a 5star review but you will learn why in this review  My friend and I celebrated our birthdays here We called 28 days in advance and got at 10 pm reservation This place can easily be missed just remember the entrance is right at the corner of Madison and an alley  We arrived right on time and were greeted by a line of employees It was like they rolled out the red carpet for us   The first course was actually the black and white cookies since it was our birthdays They tasted like Cheezits which was good because I was afraid that it was going to be sweet    Oyster  This was ok  didnt wow me but you could tell it was very fresh They did serve this really cold  I was shivering after this   Sea Urchin  Marinated with shrimp  foie gras and Chervil To be honest I didnt remember this dish come on theres 15 other dishes to remember   Sturgeon Sabayon with chive oil smoked with everything bagel crumble pickles and caviar  This was served in a little egg shell it was cute  The texture was creamy and the chive oil was on the bottom so you do have to stir it    Foie Gras Terrine with plum and bitter almond  I usually like my foie gras seared but this dish was unique  It was a terrine foie gras served in between a thin piece of cracker  The cracker was really sweet and it might have over powered the foie just a little  You couldnt really taste the foie because of how sweet the cracker was I was a little bit disappointed with this dish  Carrot tartare The waiter Jesse came our table to pureed the carrot for us There were condiments such as garlic radish sesame and so much more  They were literally asking you to play with your food because you are deciding how you want your Carrot Tartare to taste with the rye bread which by the way was perfect  It was one fun dish to explore  Lobster poached with Brussels sprouts The lobster was sweet and cooked just right The Brussels Sprouts was my favorite from this dish  It was cooked well and had a sweet taste to it because it was paired with light sauce   Squash Roasted with cranberries and sourdough  When we got the kitchen tour they were showing us how they were making this dish I love squash so this dish was delicious It was firm and not too soft    Duck Grilled with onion corn and Lardo Roasted with Turnip and huckleberries  I was very disappointed with this dish because the crust of the duck was so hard  The huckleberries actually made the dish a little too sour for me But my friend thought it was too salty    Greensward This was by far my most favorite dish As simple as it may sound the pretzel was perfect  This was served in a picnic basket and they said we will allow you to explore this basket  We didnt know what to expect   I believe that all their products in the basket was made upstate or in New Jersey and is catered to EMP The cheese pretzel and beer will blend perfectly in your mouth    Malt Ok I lied THIS was my favorite dish that Ive ever had This egg cream tops everything that Ive ever had out of all the fancy restaurants Ive been The egg cream with vanilla and Seltzer so delicious I wish I knew how they made it Okay  Im lying again I saw them make it but I really wish Id saved drops of this dessert to analyze how they made it It wasnt too sweet and it was so smooth light and creamy It was like a party in your mouth not just any party like a crazy Great Gatsby party   Apple Sorbet with bay leaf crème brulee and hibisicus This dish was really good as well You can tell the sorbet was made fresh in house along with the crème brulee   Sweet Potato cheesecake with honey and chestnut  Yes you read that right sweet potato cheesecake with honey and chestnut The three things I love in life  I love chestnuts and I love cheesecake Blend those two together with my third favorite ingredient in life and you get perfection   We got the kitchen tour and they showed us around And Nina made us a drink called Aviation  It was so good it was pretty cool crushing up the dry ice for this drink and I think it went well with the dishes that were served after the tour  They end the night with a magic show which I prefer not to spoil it for you Just dont blink  But overall the service was impeccable It was like they were trained to perfection even the presentation of the food was perfect   The only problem I had was with the wine they didnt even ask us to taste the wine at first before serving it We didnt really like our wine because it was a little flat They give you a jar of granola for your breakfast the next day to continue your tasting adventure Overall Thank You EMP for an unforgettable birthday experience and for the gift ',\n",

       " 'Summary  8 courses  Creative and likely deserves its Michelin stars but not my favorite  Good service a bit loud Try to get a table that is closer to the sides    Atmosphere  The location in the CSFB building looks like a redone gotham bank  The super high ceilings mean sound bounces in a way that is not great  I could hear everything that was said at the table next to mine yet struggled a bit to hear my party near by  In comparison the other 3 star michelins are more quiet  However that also means EMP is more lively in feel than the others which are more quiet elegance  The crowd to me looks more banker than foodie  I mean not even foodie banker just banker  A real shame  The Service In some ways they are so extremely thoughtful I cannot possibly rate them low In other ways I think the other restaurants have them sorely beat and this is despite the fact they got the Service award for the 50 Words Best restaurants list  On the good side you have extremely knowledgeable staff who can tell you everything about the menu and how its prepared and I will forgive that the person we asked didnt know if the beef was grass fed Staff watches attentively  The gift bags at the end are extremely considerate and staff has clearly been told who is coming and is gracious   On the badWe were seated toward the middle and I found myself having to track down a waitress  Additionally  and potentially because there is a bit more of a buzz in the place  service is more noticeable  Usually at the 3 star michelins service is a bit like Mr Deeds you dont notice crumbs or their removal  Here it was a bit more obvious    The Food  The  menu changes 1x per quarter and I want to try it again  There is a coherence to the use of ingredients which show up in multiple dishes to tie things together The restaurant in Jan moved from 11 courses to 8  I have heard that despite their reason  to improve the quality of each course  most feel this seasons menu wasnt as good as those in the past  Overall this is where  sadly  I took off the star  Also overall way way too much salt even I like salt Also there were some real misses that I hope will never happen again for a 3 star Michelin    Black  White cookie  3 stars Total bust  Savory in all the wrong ways Oyster on top of Creme Fraise wcaviar  5 stars Amazingly perfect  Fava Bean croquette  5 stars second best bite Peekytoe crab salad on dikon   5 stars eat it like a taco  Wonderful Eggs Benedict with caviar and ham  5 stars best bite  Extremely creative and compact If they had stopped here I would be in love Seared Fois Gras  Salty and sour which I liked but all else found it too salty Fois Gras Terraine  1 stars Total pass Salty with weird sweet Just awkward  Someone should have stopped the chef Bean Appetizer  5 stars Looks the way it tastes like spring  Delightful light and fresh 3rd best bite Lobster  4 stars  Delightful flavor well seasoned  EXTREMELY difficult to cut  Staff should have caught this and at a minimum served with a steak knife  Odd that you would have this with lobster Guys youre too good not to have caught this Also a bit salty Fluke  5 stars  The better choice for the course  Delicious light modern american Asparagus with special preparation and a bit of mash potato 4 stars  Tied for best bite but literally a bite  a single piece of asparagus with sauce so good we used the bread to sop it up Duck  4 stars  The better choice for the main  Great unique crust  However eat each part separately as putting a bit of everything french style is not a cohesive taste  The other stuff on the place doesnt go so much Steak with Eggplant  34 stars  Eh its fine  Meaty but not so notable   The Bread  salty  as is the cheese butter  Together they are way way way too salty Think salted butter with salty cheese topping in salty bread  I think the problem is the chef sourced a very salty butter that then overwhelmed the flavor Strawberrys poached with elderflower  3 stars  essentially a decomposed strawberry shortcake I like strawberry shortcake better Baked alaska  5 stars Solid execution Banana Bread Dessert  4 stars  My friends liked it  I think it was a bit salty and also this one is better in parts than when you eat a bit with everything together Chocolate game  3 stars  I like how creative the game is  I hate that they made me eat goat and sheep chocolate a taste I will never be able to get out of my mouth  bad bad bad bad bad cant we play guess the fruit in the chocolate instead ',\n",

       " 'We ate at the bar for lunch at Eleven Madison Park and it was probably the best service I experienced at any of the threestar Michelin restaurants We were not treated poorly or as though we were less important than any other diners which was so refreshing and relaxing  Since it was the lunch hour we were not looking to gorge ourselves so we skipped over smaller dishes and just went for the trout and duck for ourselves We were struggling with the decision to get bread and cheese as it was camembert and I love camembert but then they brought out complimentary bread and butter so we were good with that The bread was made inhouse as was the butter and they were both so delicious we had to restrain ourselves from eating them all at once especially since he had been warned we had a 45minute wait for the duck  When the entrees came out we were surprised that they were a little small when the waiter had described them as entreesized which must mean something different at a place that serves mostly tasting portions However they were both absolutely delicious The trout was easily my favorite of the two It was perhaps the smoothest texture Ive ever encountered in a fish and was just so delicate and tasty Then there was a sauce underneath a squash blossom I think that was this wonderfully unexpected surprise of bright flavor that paired so well with the delicacy of the fish I couldve eaten that whole dish but for the sake of trying everything we switched halfway through  I thought the duck itself was delicious However the crust had coriander seeds and some other strong spice or herb and it kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the duck We also seemed to have gotten a fat line or something as the duck had a very tough portion that we could not cut through easily The crust was also very tough and difficult to fight through both with knife and teeth I think the flavor was great but it was such a jarring texture it made it the less enjoyable dish to me I do not mean to imply it was bad it was excellent just a little less wonderful than the perfect pairing in the trout dish Then again the best part of the plate was the little surprise of a beet sauce and some sort of blossom on top  Overall an excellent meal probably some of the cleanest flavors Ive ever had I would love to go back and try the tasting menu now ',\n",
       " 'My two visits to Eleven Madison Park were within just shy of two years the first still stands as one of the best dining experiences Ive yet to have but my second The menu was no doubt considerably different and perhaps my palate had become more critical over time as well But its with a heavy heart that I have to revise my prior rating for EMP downwards  What had changed The restaurant still holds its three Michelin stars and in the time that had passed had moved upwards on San Pellegrinos list of The Worlds 50 Best Restaurants to fourth place surpassing evening Chicagos esteemed Alinea The highceilinged Art Deco building was just as majestic as I had remembered although arriving in the evening gave it a subtler less harsh appearance The very server who had overseen my first meal back in March of 2013 was there to take care of us again this evening he was able to even point to the very table I had sat in on my prior visit No it comes down to at the very end the food  The beginning was the same featuring the savory version of the Black and White Cookie with an apple filling as well as instructions to choose one of four ingredients on a popout paper sheet which later turned out to be a housemade flavored soda It was followed by a familiar bread course featuring the croissantlike rolls served with a lightly salted pat of butter as well as a small cup of venison broth The only other courses that were similar to the tasting menu Id had years back were the final two a chocolate covered pretzel with a sprinkling of sea salt as well as the final ending bite a sweet Black and White Cookie with an apple molasses filling  There were courses that shone of course I fell for the Hudson Valley Foie Gras it was seared in this iteration and served with a blood sausage base a dotting of cranberries and entwined with a leaf of kale The richness of the liver blended beautifully with the metallic tang of the blood sausage and the textural contrast in each small bite was sublime The quartet of Long Island Seafood was also memorable featuring a gorgeous bite of Oyster with Yogurt and Lemon a Scallop dotted with Pistachio and Apple marinated Blue Crab with Pickled Radish and a Vichyssoise with Caviar Smoked Blue Fish and Quail Egg Our main course which took a beautiful cut of mediumrare venison was thoughtfully composed with the accompanying braised beets and onions The course that we found the most sublime however was perhaps also the simplest one that paired a sphere of Celery Root braised with Black Truffle with a creamy celery root puree  There were dishes that werent quite as successful The play on the quintessential Pastrami on Rye couldnt compare to the original Bagel and Lox Id had almost two years back while creative the various sauces and presentations werent as refined and intertwined as their predecessor The sauce paired with the Atlantic Striped Bass was too overwhelming for my taste as the clams squid and various other shellfish that had been cooked down for it overpowered the main protein The Charcuterie course with plated several miscellaneous bites cured meats liver on toast jams and the like across a wooden board seemed haphazard and quickly strewn together And while I appreciated their take on the Baked Alaska I missed the elegance and simplicity in the desserts Id received nearly two years ago  Eleven Madison Park is still good make no mistake The service is still phenomenal welcoming and thoughtful without being invasive with each course and transition perfectly timed The 9foot windows and pristine terrazo floors are still magnificent and one of the most beautiful restaurants Ive yet to step foot into In the two visits that Ive made however the most recent one pales in comparison to the first in terms of quality and innovation of their 16 course menu Perhaps Ive also become jaded the last two years in New York City have been a rapid primer on fine dining for me and perhaps even my most recent visit to Alinea has thrown off my perspective 1 Nonetheless honesty is always the best policy in my book anyway so Ill stand by four stars for now   1 For anyone curious Alinea is worth the trip to Chicago Go ',\n",

       " 'As many other foodies if given a chance to experience the 1 restaurant in the world you do it that said Ive been to other Awesome stared Michelin restaurants and this one was just a disappointment big expectations absolutely no delivery All name food didnt back it up  First of all please understand that at no point would I call this a bad restaurant the food is fancy enough showy enough and what I do believe they excel in the service is good enough but kept on feeling cheated almost as in if I was experiencing a restaurant that got to the top and just gave up I would even doubt that the head chef was at the helm that night there was so many letdowns To the good you are received like they know you there is no checking a list or even waiting at the start if you arrive on time you will be seated right away and handed over to a very capable waitress a drink specialist and another team member whose entire job seemed to be to set up the table and sweep it up when done though even that stopped after the 4th course   of an 8 course dinner the drinks that were recommended where just plain outstanding wine and a cocktail so the bartender knows his stuffthe restaurant is big huge for new York standards  actually and nicely decorated for the holidays  and thats where Im going to have to stop the good To the not so good granted we were there on the 20th of December it was my Birthday and were celebrating our upcoming nuptials all of which they remembered  and mentioned after the redesign that they went through mid year I really thought they would have come up with a personal awesome romantic set up nope very few main tables weird for a place that big we were seated by some booths by the bar area arms reach from the next two tables and right by the entrance to the bathroom areas it was very loud oh so loud half the time you couldnt really hear the waiter when she nicely tried to explain the dishes in front of us the color the booth the set up really made me think of a Vegas all you can eat joint lighting could have made it a bit better but they decided on this yellow tint bulbs I guess to make the place more romantic well when you mess up the rest the noise and you are so close to the next table that you might as well call it family style dinning dimming the lights to a darkish yellow is just frustrating because it makes all of the food they present you with look gray and very unappetizing  To the food again not bad yet again doubt the main head chef and owner now I guess was there the food is minimalistic which is to be expected when you go for an 8 course menu definitely more leaning to French than American that said if I was to call the main ingredient of the night I would say it was SALT they go heavy on the salt on everything the bread rolls have salt and sea salt to the side every dish is Salt heavy even the desert ice cream had sea salt sprinkled over it now I got absolutely nothing against salt if anything my fiancé is the one that was suffering because she does hate salt heavy dishes but this was extreme and completely unbalanced there was nothing in the plate to run to in order to tune it down no acid no butter sauce just salty stuff packed over salty stuff there were some dishes that reminded me that we were at a fancy restaurant like the duck  I thought it was good enough for a great French spot  absolutely not good enough for Michelin but then there were others that just left me feeling cheated a mushroom dish that was nothing that a huge mushroom on the dish with some type of sauce again I LOVE Mushrooms but when you see a dish consisting of just one thing you expected to blow your mind nope together with the lighting which made it look like a weird brown blob on the dish it tasted like nothing really nothing no explosion of flavor no awesome taste of mushroom just tasted like a mushroom soaked in beef stock not even maybe vegie stock the initial offering of caviar and an assortment of little jars of jellies was just that tasted like canned stuffagain not bad but THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE RESTAURANT IN THE WORLD I dont expect to taste canned food caviar was good but so tamed that all I tasted was the cream cheese under it actually then came a pate dish that was just one big slice of pate I guess we were expected to eat it with the salty rolls but since they came at different times and there was no good explanation of the dish left me to try the pate on its own big mistake flavorless it tasked like eating butter but not good butter again I like pate and love French food this was neither  The duck dish was ok but there was barely any on the plate same with the veal barely any there and what was there was flavorless paired with a Salty sauce At the end for 700 for a dinner for two this was not close to worth it 50 a plate I would be closer ',\n",
